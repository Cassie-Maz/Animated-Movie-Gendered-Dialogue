# Progress Reports
## 1. Report 1: 7 February 2019
  * Repo created: includes README.md, LICENSE.md (blank), 
project_plan.md, progress_report.md, and .gitignore
  * Project plan outlines the data gathering and analysis necessary to 
complete the project. This may be updated as I continue with the 
project and discover new ways to explore the data.
  * License not yet specified
  * Some data explored:
    * CSV File of Princess movies has no null entries. YAY! There also 
aren't any typos in main character's names, so no editing needs to be 
done to this csv in that regard.
    * Cornell Movie corpus does not contain many animated movies, and 
the movies included are already in the Film Corpus 2.0. If the 
formatting of these movies are easier to code with, they may be used.
    * Film Corpus 2.0 explored briefly. Scripts are neat when printed, 
but look very messy when exploring them, with lots of new line 
characters. Some form of regular 
expressions will most likley be needed to divide the data by character 
dialogue
    * I'm continuing to search for animated movie corpora that are 
publically available to use.
