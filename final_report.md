## Project Summary <a name='summary'></a>
My project investigates gender differences in dialogue in Animated Movies. It looks at 12 Disney princess movies and 9 Dreamworks movies and whether female 
characters tend to adhere to what is thought of as traditionally "feminine" language.

### Background<a name='back'></a>
This project really started last semester. I was investigating how command use changed over time in Disney princess movies. I had to physically count all the 
commands uttered! It was exhausting... And since I was only looking at three movies, my findings weren't very significant. With bigger data, and the power of 
python, this project is meant to take my questions about gendered dialogue to the next level.

### Hypothesis<a name='hyp'></a>
Robin Lakoff created a list of features associated with female speech. (See my [powerpoint]()
