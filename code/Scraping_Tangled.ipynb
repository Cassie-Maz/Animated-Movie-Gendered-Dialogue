It\\xa0had the\\xa0ability to heal the sick and injured.<br/>\\nOh, you see that old woman over there? You might want to remember<br/>\\nher. She’s kind of important.</p>\\n<p>Well, centuries passed, and a hop skip and a boat ride away there\\xa0grew a kingdom. The kingdom was ruled by a beloved King and Queen.<br/>\\nAnd the Queen, (well,) she was about to have a baby. She got sick.\\xa0Really, sick.<br/>\\nShe was running out of time, and that’s when people usually start\\xa0to look for a miracle. Or in this case, a magic golden flower.</p>\\n<p>Ah, I told you she’d be important. You see, instead of sharing the\\xa0sun’s gift, this woman, Mother Gothel, hoarded its healing power and used\\xa0it to\\xa0keep herself young for hundreds of years, and all she had to do was\\xa0sing a special song.<br/>\\nG: Flower, gleam and glow<br/>\\nLet your power shine<br/>\\nMake the clock reverse<br/>\\nBring back what once was mine<br/>\\nWhat once was mine<br/>\\nF: All right, you get the gist.

You must stay here, where you’re safe. Do you understand,\\xa0flower?<br/>\\nYoung R:Yes mommy.</p>\\n<p>F: But the walls of that tower could not hide everything.<br/>\\nEach year, on her birthday, the King and Queen released thousands\\xa0of lanterns into the sky, in hope that one day, their lost princess would\\xa0return.</p>\\n<p>—</p>\\n\\n<p>[Pascal flees window to hide]<br/>\\nR: Ha!<br/>\\nHmm.

Stop\\xa0taking everything so seriously, agh.<br/>\\nR: Okay, so mother, as I was saying, tomorrow–<br/>\\nG: Rapunzel, mother’s feeling a little run-down. Would you sing for\\xa0me, dear?

Tada!<br/>\\nG: No, no, no, can’t be.

I’m going to make hazelnut soup for\\xa0dinner, your favourite–surprise!<br/>\\nR: Well mother, there’s something I want to tell you.<br/>\\nG: Oh Rapunzel, you know I hate leaving you after a fight especially\\xa0when I’ve done absolutely nothing wrong.<br/>\\nR: Okay, I’ve been thinking a lot about what you’ve said earlier\\xa0(and)…<br/>\\nG: I hope you’re not still talking about the stars.<br/>\\nR: ‘Floating Lights’, and, yes, I’m leading up to that, and…<br/>\\nG: Because I really thought we dropped the issue, sweetheart.<br/>\\nR: No, mother, I’m just saying, you think I’m not strong enough to<br/>\\nhandle myself out there.<br/>\\nG: Oh darling, I know you’re not strong enough to handle yourself out\\xa0there.<br/>\\nR: But if you just–<br/>\\nG: Rapunzel, we’re done talking about this–<br/>\\nR: Trust me–<br/>\\nG: Rapunzel–<br/>\\nR: I know what I’m saying–[puts hand on chair]<br/>\\nG: Rapunzel–<br/>\\nR: Oh, come on–<br/>\\nG: Enough of the lights, Rapunzel!

The paint made from the white shells you once brought\\xa0me.<br/>\\nG: Well, that is a very long trip, Rapunzel.

And how did you find me?<br/>\\nF: Aha.<br/>\\nR: Who are you, and how did you find me?<br/>\\nF: Mm-hm. I know not who you are, nor how I came to find you, but may<br/>\\nI just say…<br/>\\nHi. How ya doin’? The name’s Flynn Rider. How’s your day goin’?\\xa0Huh?<br/>\\nR: Ugh!<br/>\\nWho else knows my location, Flynn Rider?<br/>\\nF: All right, blondie–<br/>\\nR: Rapunzel.<br/>\\nF: Gesundheit. Here’s the deal.<br/>\\nI was in a situation, gallivanting through the forest. I came\\xa0across your tower and… ho, oh no… where is my satchel?<br/>\\nR: I’ve hidden it, somewhere you’ll never find it.<br/>\\nF: It’s in that pot, isn’t it?<br/>\\n[A bang by frying pan.]<br/>\\nF: Er, uh. Huh? [realizes Pascal’s tongue stuck in his ear]<br/>\\nYike! [shakes off Pascal] Would you stop that?<br/>\\nR: Now it’s hidden where you’ll never find it.<br/>\\nSo, what do you want with my hair? To cut it?<br/>\\nF: What?<br/>\\nR: Sell it?<br/>\\nF: No! Listen, the only thing I want to do with your hair is to get<br/>\\nout of it. Literally.<br/>\\nR: Yi. Wait. You don’t want my hair?<br/>\\nF: Why on earth would I want your hair? Look, I was being chased, I<br/>\\nsaw a tower, I climbed it, end of story.<br/>\\nR: You’re… telling the truth?<br/>\\nF: Yes.<br/>\\n[Pascal distrusts]<br/>\\nR: I know, I need someone to take me.<br/>\\n[Pascal motions]<br/>\\nR: I think he’s telling the truth, too.<br/>\\n[Pascal motions]<br/>\\nR: (He) doesn’t have fangs, but what choice do I have?<br/>\\n[F struggles]<br/>\\nR: Huh. Okay, Flynn Rider, I’m prepared to offer you a deal.<br/>\\nF: Deal?<br/>\\nR: Look this way.<br/>\\n[F collapses with chair]<br/>\\nR: Do you know what these are?<br/>\\nF: You mean the lantern thing they do for the princess?<br/>\\nR: Lanterns. I knew they weren’t stars.<br/>\\nWell, tomorrow evening they will light the night sky with these\\xa0lanterns.<br/>\\nYou will act as my guide, take me to these lanterns, and return me\\xa0home safely. Then, and only then, will I return your satchel to you. That\\xa0is my\\xa0deal.<br/>\\nF: Yeah. No can do. Unfortunately, the kingdom and I aren’t exactly\\xa0‘simpatico’ at the moment. So I won’t be taking you anywhere.<br/>\\n[Pascal: get tough. R pulls F up]<br/>\\nR: Something brought you here, Flynn Rider. Call it what you will:\\xa0fate, destiny…<br/>\\nF: A horse.<br/>\\nR: So I have made the decision to trust you.<br/>\\nF: A horrible decision, really.<br/>\\nR: But trust me when I tell you this.<br/>\\n[R tugs hair, F falls forward]<br/>\\nF: Ugh!<br/>\\n[R catches chair]<br/>\\nR: You can tear this tower apart brick by brick, but without my help,\\xa0you will never find your precious satchel.<br/>\\nF: Hmm-mm. Let me just get this straight. I take you to see the\\xa0lanterns, bring you back home, and you’ll give me back my satchel?<br/>\\nR: I promise.<br/>\\n[F in disbelief]<br/>\\nR: And when I promise something, I never ever break that promise.<br/>\\n[F in disbelief]<br/>\\nR: Ever.<br/>\\n[Pascal nods.

Welcome home, mother.<br/>\\nG: Uh, Rapunzel! How you manage to do that every single day without\\xa0fail!

Alright, so, mother, as you know, tomorrow is a very\\xa0big day–<br/>\\nG: Rapunzel, look in that mirror. You know what I see?

Stop\\xa0taking everything so seriously, agh.<br/>\\nR: Okay, so mother, as I was saying, tomorrow–<br/>\\nG: Rapunzel, mother’s feeling a little run-down. Would you sing for\\xa0me, dear?

Tada!<br/>\\nG: No, no, no, can’t be. I distinctly remember: your birthday was last\\xa0year.<br/>\\nR: That’s the funny thing about birthdays–they’re kind of an annual\\xa0thing!\\xa0Uh.<br/>\\nMother, I’m turning eighteen, and I wanted to ask, uh, what I\\xa0really want for this birthday…<br/>\\nActually what I really want for my birth–want for my birth–<br/>\\nG: Okay, Rapunzel, please, stop with the mumbling.

Now I’m the bad guy.<br/>\\n[R sees her painting of the lights, then at her closet.]<br/>\\nR: All I was gonna say, mother, is that, I know what I want for my\\xa0birthday now.<br/>\\nG: And what is that?<br/>\\nR: New paint. The paint made from the white shells you once brought\\xa0me.<br/>\\nG: Well, that is a very long trip, Rapunzel. Almost three days’ time.<br/>\\nR: I just thought it was a better idea than… stars.<br/>\\nG: Ugh.<br/>\\nYou’re sure you’ll be all right on your own?<br/>\\nR: I know I’m safe as long as I’m here.<br/>\\nG: [kisses R]<br/>\\nI’ll be back in three days’ time.<br/>\\nI love you very much, dear.<br/>\\nR: I love you more.<br/>\\nG: I love you most.<br/>\\n[As soon as G vanishes, R rushes back to her closet]</p>\\n<p>R: [deep breath] Okay.<br/>\\n[opens closet, F falls out]<br/>\\nUh?<br/>\\n[examines F]<br/>\\nHmm.<br/>\\n[R pulls chair.

How’s your day goin’?\\xa0Huh?<br/>\\nR: Ugh!<br/>\\nWho else knows my location, Flynn Rider?<br/>\\nF: All right, blondie–<br/>\\nR: Rapunzel.<br/>\\nF: Gesundheit. Here’s the deal.<br/>\\nI was in a situation, gallivanting through the forest. I came\\xa0across your tower and… ho, oh no… where is my satchel?<br/>\\nR: I’ve hidden it, somewhere you’ll never find it.<br/>\\nF: It’s in that pot, isn’t it?<br/>\\n[A bang by frying pan.]<br/>\\nF: Er, uh. Huh? [realizes Pascal’s tongue stuck in his ear]<br/>\\nYike! [shakes off Pascal] Would you stop that?<br/>\\nR: Now it’s hidden where you’ll never find it.<br/>\\nSo, what do you want with my hair?

Okay, Flynn Rider, I’m prepared to offer you a deal.<br/>\\nF: Deal?<br/>\\nR: Look this way.<br/>\\n[F collapses with chair]<br/>\\nR: Do you know what these are?<br/>\\nF: You mean the lantern thing they do for the princess?<br/>\\nR: Lanterns. I knew they weren’t stars.<br/>\\nWell, tomorrow evening they will light the night sky with these\\xa0lanterns.<br/>\\nYou will act as my guide, take me to these lanterns, and return me\\xa0home safely. Then, and only then, will I return your satchel to you. That\\xa0is my\\xa0deal.<br/>\\nF: Yeah. No can do. Unfortunately, the kingdom and I aren’t exactly\\xa0‘simpatico’ at the moment. So I won’t be taking you anywhere.<br/>\\n[Pascal: get tough. R pulls F up]<br/>\\nR: Something brought you here, Flynn Rider.

Overprotective\\xa0mother, forbidden road trip. I mean, this is serious stuff.\\xa0But let me ease your conscience.<br/>\\nThis is part of growing up. A little rebellion, a little adventure–that’s good, healthy even!<br/>\\nR: You think?<br/>\\nF: I know. You’re way over-thinking this, trust me. Does your mother\\xa0deserve it? No. Would this break her heart and crush her soul? Of course.\\xa0But you\\xa0just got to do it.<br/>\\nR: ‘Break her heart?’<br/>\\nF: In half.<br/>\\nR: ‘Crush her soul?’<br/>\\nF: [squeezes grape] Like a grape.<br/>\\nR: She would be heartbroken, you’re right.<br/>\\nF: I am, aren’t I? Oh bother.<br/>\\nAll right, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m letting you out\\xa0of the deal.<br/>\\nR: What?<br/>\\nF: That’s right. But don’t thank me. Let’s just turn around and get\\xa0you home (/find your pan)–and your frog–I get back my satchel, you get\\xa0back a\\xa0mother-daughter relationship based on mutual trust and voila!
