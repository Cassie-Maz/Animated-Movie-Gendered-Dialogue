       "'—_NEWLINE_<br/ This is the story of how I died.<br/>Don’t worry, this is actually a very fun story and the truth is, it isn’t even mine.<br/>This is the story of a girl named Rapunzel and it starts with the sun.</p><p>Now, once upon a time, a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens and from this small drop of sun, grew a magic, golden flower. It had the ability to heal the sick and injured.<br/>Oh, you see that old woman over there? You might want to remember<br/>her. She’s kind of important.</p><p>Well, centuries passed, and a hop skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom. The kingdom was ruled by a beloved King and Queen.<br/>And the Queen, (well,) she was about to have a baby. She got sick. Really, sick.<br/>She was running out of time, and that’s when people usually start to look for a miracle. Or in this case, a magic golden flower.</p><p>Ah, I told you she’d be important. You see, instead of sharing the sun’s gift, this woman, Mother Gothel, hoarded its healing power and used it to keep herself young for hundreds of years, and all she had to do was sing a special song._NEWLINE_<br/ Flower, gleam and glow<br/>Let your power shine<br/>Make the clock reverse<br/>Bring back what once was mine<br/>What once was mine_NEWLINE_<br/ All right, you get the gist. She sings to it, she turns young, creepy, right?_NEWLINE_<br/ We’ve found it!</p><_NEWLINE_p The magic of the golden flower healed the queen.<br/>A healthy baby girl, a princess was born, with beautiful golden hair.<br/>I’ll give you a hint: that’s Rapunzel.<br/>To celebrate her birth, the King and Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky. And for that one moment, everything was perfect.</p><p>And then that moment ended._NEWLINE_<br/ Flower, gleam and glow<br/>Let your power shine<br/>Make the clock re- _NEWLINE_<br/ Gothel broke into the castle, stole the child and just like that–<br/>gone.</p><p>The kingdom searched and searched but they could not find the princess. For deep within the forest, in a hidden tower, Gothel raised the child as her own._NEWLINE_<br/(Heal what has been hurt)<br/>(Change the fate’s design)<br/>Save what has been lost<br/>Bring back what once was mine<br/>What once was mine_NEWLINE_<br/ Gothel had found her new magic flower, but this time she was determined to keep it hidden._NEWLINE_<br/ Why can’t I go outside?_NEWLINE_<br/ The outside world is a dangerous place, filled with horrible, selfish people. You must stay here, where you’re safe. Do you understand, flower?_NEWLINE_<br/Yes mommy.</p><_NEWLINE_p But the walls of that tower could not hide everything.<br/>Each year, on her birthday, the King and Queen released thousands of lanterns into the sky, in hope that one day, their lost princess would return.</p><p>—</p><p>_NEWLINE_<br/ Ha!<br/>Hmm. Well, I guess Pascal’s not hiding out here…<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Gotcha!<br/>That’s twenty-two for me. How about twenty-three out of forty-five?<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Okay, well, what do you wanna do?<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Yeah, I don’t think so. I like it in here and so do you.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Oh come on Pascal, it’s not so bad in there…<br/><br/>Seven a.m., the usual morning lineup<br/>Start up the chores and sweep till the floor’s all clean<br/>Polish and wax, do laundry, and mop and shine up<br/>Sweep again, and by then it’s, like, seven-fifteen<br/>And so I’ll read a book or maybe two or three<br/>I’ll add a few new paintings to my gallery<br/>I’ll play guitar and knit and cook and basically<br/>Just wonder when will my life begin?<br/><br/>Then after lunch it’s puzzles and darts and baking<br/>Papier-mache, a bit of ballet and chess<br/>Pottery and ventriloquy, candle-making<br/>Then I’ll stretch, maybe sketch, take a climb, sew a dress!<br/>And I’ll re-read the books if I have time to spare<br/>I’ll paint the walls some more, I’m sure there’s room somewhere<br/>And then I’ll brush and brush and brush and brush my hair<br/>Stuck in the same place I’ve always been<br/>And I’ll keep wondering and wondering and wondering and wondering<br/>When will my life begin?<br/><br/>Tomorrow night, the lights will appear<br/>Just like they do on my birthday each year<br/>What is it like out there where they glow?<br/>Now that I’m older, Mother might just let me go…<br/>—_NEWLINE_<br/ Wow! I could get used to a view like this._NEWLINE_<br/ Rider! C’mon!_NEWLINE_<br/ Hold on. Yup. I’m used to it. Guys I want a castle._NEWLINE_<br/ We do this job. You can buy your own castle.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Oh. Hay fever?_NEWLINE_<br/ Yea.<br/> Huh?<br/>Hey, wait. Hey, wait!_NEWLINE_<br/ Can’t you picture me in a castle of my own? Coz I certainly can. All the things we’ve seen and it’s only eight in the morning (0800). Gentlemen this is a very big day!<br/>—_NEWLINE_<br/ This is it. This is a very big day, Pascal. Hmm-mm. I’m finally gonna do it. I’m gonna ask her._NEWLINE_<br/  Rapunzel!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Let down your hair!_NEWLINE_<br/ It’s time.  I know, I know, come on, don’t let her see you._NEWLINE_<br/  Rapunzel, I’m not getting any younger down here._NEWLINE_<br/ Coming, mother! <br/>Hi. Welcome home, mother._NEWLINE_<br/ Uh, Rapunzel! How you manage to do that every single day without fail! It looks absolutely exhausting, darling._NEWLINE_<br/ Oh, it’s nothing._NEWLINE_<br/ Then I don’t know why it takes so long! Ergh, ho-ho-ho-ho, darling, I’m just teasing._NEWLINE_<br/ Hmm, he-he-he. Alright, so, mother, as you know, tomorrow is a very big day–_NEWLINE_<br/ Rapunzel, look in that mirror. You know what I see? I see a strong, confident, beautiful young lady.<br/>Oh look, you’re here too. Er-ha-ha-ha-ha, I’m just teasing! Stop taking everything so seriously, agh._NEWLINE_<br/ Okay, so mother, as I was saying, tomorrow–_NEWLINE_<br/ Rapunzel, mother’s feeling a little run-down. Would you sing for me, dear? That’ll do._NEWLINE_<br/ Oh! Of course, mother. <br/> Flower, gleam and glow<br/>Let your power shine<br/>Make the clock reverse_NEWLINE_<br/ –Wait!–_NEWLINE_<br/ Bring back what once was mine_NEWLINE_<br/ –Wait!–_NEWLINE_<br/ Heal what has been hurt<br/>Change the fate’s design<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Save what has been lost<br/>Bring back what once was mine_NEWLINE_<br/ Rapunzel!_NEWLINE_<br/ So, mother, earlier I was saying tomorrow’s a pretty big day and you didn’t really respond, so I’m just gonna tell you, it’s my birthday! Uh. Tada!_NEWLINE_<br/ No, no, no, can’t be. I distinctly remember: your birthday was last year._NEWLINE_<br/ That’s the funny thing about birthdays–they’re kind of an annual thing! Uh.<br/>Mother, I’m turning eighteen, and I wanted to ask, uh, what I really want for this birthday…<br/>Actually what I really want for my birth–want for my birth–_NEWLINE_<br/ Okay, Rapunzel, please, stop with the mumbling. You know how I feel about the mumbling–blah-blah-blah-blah, it’s very annoying, I’m just teasing, you’re adorable, I love you so much, darling. Agh.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Agh, I want to see the floating lights._NEWLINE_<br/ Uh-huh. What?_NEWLINE_<br/ Oh. Well, I was hoping you would take me to see the floating lights._NEWLINE_<br/ Oo. You mean the stars._NEWLINE_<br/ That’s the thing.<br/>I’ve charted stars and they’re always constant–but these–they appear every year on my birthday, mother–ONLY on my birthday. And I can’t help but feel like they’re… they’re meant for me.<br/>I need to see them, mother, and not just from my window. In person.<br/>I have to know what they are._NEWLINE_<br/ You want to go outside? Why, Rapunzel!<br/>Look at you, as fragile as a flower<br/>Still a little sapling, just a sprout<br/>You know why we stay up in this tower_NEWLINE_<br/ I know but…_NEWLINE_<br/ That’s right, to keep you safe and sound, dear<br/>Guess I always knew this day was coming<br/>Knew that soon you’d want to leave the nest<br/>Soon, but not yet_NEWLINE_<br/ But–_NEWLINE_<br/ Shh! Trust me, pet<br/>Mother knows best<br/><br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Mother knows best<br/>Listen to your mother_NEWLINE_<br/ Agh!_NEWLINE_<br/ It’s a scary world out there<br/>Mother knows best<br/>One way or another<br/>Something will go wrong, I swear<br/>Ruffians, thugs, poison ivy, quicksand<br/>Cannibals and snakes… The plague!_NEWLINE_<br/ No!_NEWLINE_<br/ Yes!_NEWLINE_<br/ But–_NEWLINE_<br/ Also large bugs_NEWLINE_<br/ Agh!_NEWLINE_<br/ Men with pointy teeth, and stop, no more, you’ll just upset me<br/>Mother’s right here, mother will protect you<br/>Darling here’s what I suggest<br/>Skip the drama, stay with mama<br/>Mother knows best<br/>Ah, hahahaha…<br/>Mother knows best<br/>Take it from your mumsy<br/>On your own, you won’t survive<br/>Sloppy, underdressed, immature, clumsy<br/>Please, they’ll eat you up alive<br/>Gullible, naive, positively grubby<br/>Ditzy and a bit, well, hmm vague<br/>Plus, I believe, gettin’ kinda chubby<br/>I’m just saying ’cause I wuv you<br/>Mother understands, mother’s here to help you<br/>All I have is one request<br/>Rapunzel?_NEWLINE_<br/ Yes?_NEWLINE_<br/ Don’t ever ask to leave this tower again._NEWLINE_<br/ Yes, Mother._NEWLINE_<br/ Uh, I love you very much, dear._NEWLINE_<br/ I love you more._NEWLINE_<br/ I love you most. <br/>Don’t forget it, you’ll regret it<br/>Mother knows best!</p><_NEWLINE_p Rapunzel! I’ll see you in a bit, my flower._NEWLINE_<br/ I’ll be here.<br/>—_NEWLINE_<br/ Uh, uh… Agh! Oh no. No no no no no no no no no no, this is bad, this is very very bad, this is really bad… They just can’t get my nose right!_NEWLINE_<br/ Who cares?_NEWLINE_<br/ Well it’s easy for you to say! You guys look amazing.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Uh, all right, okay, give me a boost, and I’ll pull you up._NEWLINE_<br/ Give us the satchel first._NEWLINE_<br/ Uh? I just–I can’t believe that after all we’ve been through together, you don’t trust me? Ouch._NEWLINE_<br/ Now help us up, pretty boy._NEWLINE_<br/ Sorry, my hands are full._NEWLINE_<br/ What? Rider!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Retrieve that satchel at any cost!_NEWLINE_<br/ Yes sir!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ We got him now, Maximus!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Ya, haha! –Ooh!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Ugh! Come on, fleabag, forward!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ No!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ No! Stop it, stop it! Give it to me–give me that!–<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Ha!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Aghhhhh! <br/>_NEWLINE_<br/  Alone at last.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Agh! <br/><br/><br/><br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Oh. _NEWLINE_<br/ Huh?<br/></p><p>_NEWLINE_<br/ Okay, okay, okay, I’ve got a person in my closet.<br/>I’ve got a person in my closet.<br/>I’ve got a person in my closet! Haha! Uh!<br/>Too weak to handle myself out there, huh, mother? Well… hmm-hmm…tell that to my frying pan–<br/> Huh?<br/><br/><br/>_NEWLINE_<br/  Rapunzel!_NEWLINE_<br/  Oh!_NEWLINE_<br/  Let down your hair!_NEWLINE_<br/ One moment, mother!_NEWLINE_<br/  I have a big surprise!_NEWLINE_<br/ Uh, I do too!_NEWLINE_<br/ Oo, I bet my surprise is bigger!_NEWLINE_<br/ I seriously doubt it. _NEWLINE_<br/ I brought back parsnips. I’m going to make hazelnut soup for dinner, your favourite–surprise!_NEWLINE_<br/ Well mother, there’s something I want to tell you._NEWLINE_<br/ Oh Rapunzel, you know I hate leaving you after a fight especially when I’ve done absolutely nothing wrong._NEWLINE_<br/ Okay, I’ve been thinking a lot about what you’ve said earlier (and)…_NEWLINE_<br/ I hope you’re not still talking about the stars._NEWLINE_<br/ ‘Floating Lights’, and, yes, I’m leading up to that, and…_NEWLINE_<br/ Because I really thought we dropped the issue, sweetheart._NEWLINE_<br/ No, mother, I’m just saying, you think I’m not strong enough to<br/>handle myself out there._NEWLINE_<br/ Oh darling, I know you’re not strong enough to handle yourself out there._NEWLINE_<br/ But if you just–_NEWLINE_<br/ Rapunzel, we’re done talking about this–_NEWLINE_<br/ Trust me–_NEWLINE_<br/ Rapunzel–_NEWLINE_<br/ I know what I’m saying–_NEWLINE_<br/ Rapunzel–_NEWLINE_<br/ Oh, come on–_NEWLINE_<br/ Enough of the lights, Rapunzel! You are not leaving this tower!<br/>Ever!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Ugh, great. Now I’m the bad guy.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ All I was gonna say, mother, is that, I know what I want for my birthday now._NEWLINE_<br/ And what is that?_NEWLINE_<br/ New paint. The paint made from the white shells you once brought me._NEWLINE_<br/ Well, that is a very long trip, Rapunzel. Almost three days’ time._NEWLINE_<br/ I just thought it was a better idea than… stars._NEWLINE_<br/ Ugh.<br/>You’re sure you’ll be all right on your own?_NEWLINE_<br/ I know I’m safe as long as I’m here._NEWLINE_<br/ <br/>I’ll be back in three days’ time.<br/>I love you very much, dear._NEWLINE_<br/ I love you more._NEWLINE_<br/ I love you most.<br/></p><_NEWLINE_p  Okay.<br/><br/>Uh?<br/><br/>Hmm.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Agh! Huh? Uh?  Is this hair?_NEWLINE_<br/ Struggling… struggling is pointless._NEWLINE_<br/ Huh?_NEWLINE_<br/ I know why you’re here, and I’m not afraid of you._NEWLINE_<br/ What?<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Who are you? And how did you find me?_NEWLINE_<br/ Aha._NEWLINE_<br/ Who are you, and how did you find me?_NEWLINE_<br/ Mm-hm. I know not who you are, nor how I came to find you, but may<br/>I just say…<br/>Hi. How ya doin’? The name’s Flynn Rider. How’s your day goin’? Huh?_NEWLINE_<br/ Ugh!<br/>Who else knows my location, Flynn Rider?_NEWLINE_<br/ All right, blondie–_NEWLINE_<br/ Rapunzel._NEWLINE_<br/ Gesundheit. Here’s the deal.<br/>I was in a situation, gallivanting through the forest. I came across your tower and… ho, oh no… where is my satchel?_NEWLINE_<br/ I’ve hidden it, somewhere you’ll never find it._NEWLINE_<br/ It’s in that pot, isn’t it?<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Er, uh. Huh? <br/>Yike!  Would you stop that?_NEWLINE_<br/ Now it’s hidden where you’ll never find it.<br/>So, what do you want with my hair? To cut it?_NEWLINE_<br/ What?_NEWLINE_<br/ Sell it?_NEWLINE_<br/ No! Listen, the only thing I want to do with your hair is to get<br/>out of it. Literally._NEWLINE_<br/ Yi. Wait. You don’t want my hair?_NEWLINE_<br/ Why on earth would I want your hair? Look, I was being chased, I<br/>saw a tower, I climbed it, end of story._NEWLINE_<br/ You’re… telling the truth?_NEWLINE_<br/ Yes.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ I know, I need someone to take me.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ I think he’s telling the truth, too.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ (He) doesn’t have fangs, but what choice do I have?<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Huh. Okay, Flynn Rider, I’m prepared to offer you a deal._NEWLINE_<br/ Deal?_NEWLINE_<br/ Look this way.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Do you know what these are?_NEWLINE_<br/ You mean the lantern thing they do for the princess?_NEWLINE_<br/ Lanterns. I knew they weren’t stars.<br/>Well, tomorrow evening they will light the night sky with these lanterns.<br/>You will act as my guide, take me to these lanterns, and return me home safely. Then, and only then, will I return your satchel to you. That is my deal._NEWLINE_<br/ Yeah. No can do. Unfortunately, the kingdom and I aren’t exactly ‘simpatico’ at the moment. So I won’t be taking you anywhere.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Something brought you here, Flynn Rider. Call it what you will: fate, destiny…_NEWLINE_<br/ A horse._NEWLINE_<br/ So I have made the decision to trust you._NEWLINE_<br/ A horrible decision, really._NEWLINE_<br/ But trust me when I tell you this.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Ugh!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ You can tear this tower apart brick by brick, but without my help, you will never find your precious satchel._NEWLINE_<br/ Hmm-mm. Let me just get this straight. I take you to see the lanterns, bring you back home, and you’ll give me back my satchel?_NEWLINE_<br/ I promise.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ And when I promise something, I never ever break that promise.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Ever.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ All right, listen, I didn’t want to have to do this, but you leave me no choice. Here comes the ‘smoulder’.<br/><br/>This is kind of an off day for me. This doesn’t normally happen.<br/>… Fine, I’ll take you to see the lanterns!_NEWLINE_<br/ Really?<br/>Oops._NEWLINE_<br/ You broke my ‘smoulder’.</p><_NEWLINE_p You comin’, blondie?<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Look at the world so close, and I’m halfway to it!<br/>Look at it all so big, do I even dare?<br/>Look at me, there at last! I just have to do it<br/>Should I? No. Here I go…<br/><br/>Just smell the grass! The dirt! Just like I dreamed they’d be!<br/>Just feel that summer breeze, the way it’s calling me<br/>For like the first time ever, I’m completely free!<br/>I could go running, and racing, and dancing, and chasing<br/>And leaping, and bounding, hair flying, heart pounding<br/>And splashing, and reeling, and finally feeling<br/>That’s when my life begins!<br/><br/>I can’t believe I did this.<br/>*I can’t believe I did this.*<br/>I can’t believe I did this! Haha.<br/>*Mother would be so furious.*<br/>That’s okay! I mean, what she doesn’t know won’t kill her, right?<br/>*Oh my gosh, this would kill her.*<br/>This is so fun!<br/>*I am a horrible daughter. I’m going back.*<br/>I am never going back! Woo-hoo!<br/>*I am a despicable human being.*<br/>Woo-hoo! Best. Day. Ever!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Hmm-mm-m.<br/>You know, I can’t help but notice you seem a little at war with yourself here._NEWLINE_<br/  What?_NEWLINE_<br/ Now, I’m only picking up bits and pieces, of course. Overprotective mother, forbidden road trip. I mean, this is serious stuff. But let me ease your conscience.<br/>This is part of growing up. A little rebellion, a little adventure–that’s good, healthy even!_NEWLINE_<br/ You think?_NEWLINE_<br/ I know. You’re way over-thinking this, trust me. Does your mother deserve it? No. Would this break her heart and crush her soul? Of course. But you just got to do it._NEWLINE_<br/ ‘Break her heart?’_NEWLINE_<br/ In half._NEWLINE_<br/ ‘Crush her soul?’_NEWLINE_<br/  Like a grape._NEWLINE_<br/ She would be heartbroken, you’re right._NEWLINE_<br/ I am, aren’t I? Oh bother.<br/>All right, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m letting you out of the deal._NEWLINE_<br/ What?_NEWLINE_<br/ That’s right. But don’t thank me. Let’s just turn around and get you home (/find your pan)–and your frog–I get back my satchel, you get back a mother-daughter relationship based on mutual trust and voila! We part ways as unlikely friends._NEWLINE_<br/ No! I am seeing those lanterns–_NEWLINE_<br/ Oh come on! What is it going to take to get my satchel back?_NEWLINE_<br/ I will use this.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/  Is it ruffians? Thugs? Have they come for me?<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Stay calm. It can probably smell fear._NEWLINE_<br/ Oh, huh, sorry. Guess I’m just a little bit… jumpy._NEWLINE_<br/ Probably be best if we avoid ruffians and thugs, though._NEWLINE_<br/ Uh-huh, yeah, that’d probably be best._NEWLINE_<br/  Are you hungry? I know a great place for lunch._NEWLINE_<br/ Oh.<br/>Where?_NEWLINE_<br/ Oh don’t you worry. You’ll know it when you smell it.<br/>—<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Huh!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Uh, a Palace horse. Where’s your rider? Rapunzel.<br/>RAPUNZEL!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Rapunzel, let down your hair!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Rapunzel?<br/><br/>Rapunzel?<br/><br/>RAPUNZEL!<br/><br/>—_NEWLINE_<br/ I know it’s around here, somewhere.<br/>Ah, there it is, the Snuggly Duckling.<br/>Don’t worry, very quaint place, perfect for you. Don’t want you scaring and giving up on this whole endeavour now do we?_NEWLINE_<br/ Well, I do like duckling._NEWLINE_<br/ YAY!</p><p>_NEWLINE_<br/ Garcon, your finest table please!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ You smell that? Take a deep breath through the nose.<br/> Really let that seep in._NEWLINE_<br/ Agh!_NEWLINE_<br/ What are you getting? Because to me,…_NEWLINE_<br/ Agh!_NEWLINE_<br/ … that’s part man-smell, and the other part is really bad man-smell. I don’t know why, but overall  it just smells like the color brown. Your thoughts?<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ That’s a lot of hair._NEWLINE_<br/ She’s growing it out. Is that blood in your moustache? Goldie, look at this. Look at all the blood in his moustache.<br/>That, sir, that’s a lot of blood.<br/>Hey, you don’t look so good, blondie. Maybe we should get you a home. Call it a day.<br/>Probably be better off. This is a five star joint after all, and if you can’t handle this place, well, maybe you should be back in your tower.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Is this you?<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Aw. Now they’re just being mean._NEWLINE_<br/ Ho, ho, it’s him all right. Greno, go find some guards! That reward’s going to buy me a new hook._NEWLINE_<br/ I could use the money._NEWLINE_<br/ What about me? I’m broke.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Please, stop!_NEWLINE_<br/ We can work this out._NEWLINE_<br/ Please, leave him alone!_NEWLINE_<br/ Gentlemen, please!_NEWLINE_<br/ Give me back my guide!<br/>Ruffians!_NEWLINE_<br/  Not the nose, not the nose, not the nose!_NEWLINE_<br/ Put him down!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Whoa! Okay, I don’t know where I am, and I need him to take me to see the lanterns because I’ve been dreaming about them my entire life! Find your humanity! Haven’t any of you ever had a dream?<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ I had a dream… once.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ I’m malicious, mean and scary<br/>My sneer could curdle dairy<br/>And violence-wise, my hands are not the cleanest<br/>But despite my evil look<br/>And my temper and my hook<br/>I’ve always yearned to be a concert pianist<br/><br/>Can’tcha see me on the stage performin’ Mozart?<br/>Tickling the ivories ’til they gleam?<br/>Yep, I’d rather be called deadly<br/>For my killer show-tune medley<br/>–Thank you!<br/>‘Cause way down deep inside I’ve got a dream_NEWLINE_<br/ He’s got a dream!

Sorry boys, I don’t sing.<br/><br/>I have dreams, like you, no, really<br/>Just much less touchy-feely<br/>They mainly happen somewhere warm and sunny<br/>On an island that I own, tanned and rested and alone<br/>Surrounded by enormous piles of money<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ I’ve got a dream!_NEWLINE_<br/ She’s got a dream!_NEWLINE_<br/ I’ve got a dream!_NEWLINE_<br/ She’s got a dream!_NEWLINE_<br/ I just want to see the floating lanterns gleam!_NEWLINE_<br/ Yeahh!_NEWLINE_<br/ And with every passing hour<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ I’m so glad I left my tower<br/>Like all you lovely folks, I’ve got a dream_NEWLINE_<br/ She’s got a dream!

Where’s that tunnel led out?_NEWLINE_<br/ Knife!<br/>—_NEWLINE_<br/ Well, I’ve got to say, didn’t know you had that in you back there. That was pretty impressive._NEWLINE_<br/ I know! I know.<br/>So, Flynn, where’re you from?_NEWLINE_<br/ Whoo-oo! Sorry, blondie, I don’t do back-story. However I am becoming very interested in yours. Now I, I know I’m not supposed to mention the hair._NEWLINE_<br/ Nope._NEWLINE_<br/ Or the mother._NEWLINE_<br/ Ah, ah._NEWLINE_<br/ Frankly I’m too scared to ask about the frog._NEWLINE_<br/ Chameleon._NEWLINE_<br/ Nuance. Here’s my question (though,): if you want to see the lanterns so badly, why haven’t you gone before?_NEWLINE_<br/ Uh. Huh, well… uh, Flynn… Flynn…_NEWLINE_<br/ Rider!_NEWLINE_<br/ Run!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Who’s that?_NEWLINE_<br/ They don’t like me.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Who’s that?_NEWLINE_<br/ They don’t like me either.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Who’s that?!_NEWLINE_<br/ Let’s just assume for the moment that everyone in here doesn’t like me!_NEWLINE_<br/ Here!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ I’ve waited a long time for this.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Oh mama, I have got to get me one of these!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Ha!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ You should know that this is the strangest thing I’ve ever done!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ How ’bout two out of three?_NEWLINE_<br/ Flynn!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Flynn, look out!_NEWLINE_<br/ Whoa, whoa…_NEWLINE_<br/ Ngth!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Ha!

It’s pitch-black down there._NEWLINE_<br/ This is all my fault. She was right, I never should have done this.<br/> I’m so… I’m so sorry, Flynn. _NEWLINE_<br/ Eugene._NEWLINE_<br/ What?_NEWLINE_<br/ My real name is Eugene Fitzherbert.<br/>Someone might as well know._NEWLINE_<br/ Hmm.<br/>I have magic hair that glows when I sing._NEWLINE_<br/ What?_NEWLINE_<br/ I have magic hair that glows when I sing! Flower gleam and glow, let your power shine…_NEWLINE_<br/  Whoa!<br/></p><p>_NEWLINE_<br/ We made it._NEWLINE_<br/ Her hair glows._NEWLINE_<br/ I’m alive. I’m alive!_NEWLINE_<br/ I didn’t see that coming._NEWLINE_<br/ Eugene._NEWLINE_<br/ Her hair actually glows._NEWLINE_<br/ Eugene._NEWLINE_<br/ Why does her hair glow?_NEWLINE_<br/ Eugene!_NEWLINE_<br/ What?_NEWLINE_<br/ It doesn’t just glow._NEWLINE_<br/ Why is he  smiling at me?<br/>—_NEWLINE_<br/ I’ll kill ‘im. I’ll kill that Rider!<br/>We’ll cut him off at the kingdom, and get back the crown. C’mon!_NEWLINE_<br/ Boys!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Perhaps you want to stop acting like wild dogs chasing their tails and think for a moment.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Oh-ho, please, there’s no need for that.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Well, if that’s all that you desire then be on your way. I was going to offer you something worth one thousand crowns, would have made you rich beyond belief and that wasn’t even the best part, hoho, oh well,<br/>c’est la vie. Enjoy your crown._NEWLINE_<br/ What’s the best part?_NEWLINE_<br/ It comes with revenge on Flynn Rider.<br/>—_NEWLINE_<br/ So you’re being strangely cryptic as you wrap your magic hair around my injured hand.<br/>Agh!_NEWLINE_<br/ Sorry.  Just don’t… don’t freak out.<br/><br/>Flower, gleam and glow<br/>Let your power shine<br/>Make the clock reverse<br/>Bring back what once was mine<br/><br/>Heal what has been hurt<br/>Change the fate’s design<br/>Save what has been lost<br/>Bring back what once was mine<br/><br/>What once was mine_NEWLINE_<br/ _NEWLINE_<br/ (Please) don’t freak out!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Arrrr.

They wanted to take it for themselves. But, once it’s cut, it turns brown and loses its power. A gift like that, it has to be protected. That’s why mother never let me…  That’s why I never left the… hmm._NEWLINE_<br/ … You never left that tower.<br/><br/>And you’re still gonna go back?_NEWLINE_<br/ No! Yes. Ugh! It’s complicated.<br/>Hah. So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?_NEWLINE_<br/ Uh, yeah. Well. I’ll spare you the sob story of poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert, it’s a little bit of a… that’s a little bit of a downer.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Huh.<br/>There was this book, a book I used to read every night to all the younger kids – ‘The Tales of Flynnigan Rider’. Swashbuckling rogue, richest man alive, not bad with the ladies, either. Not that he would to brag about it, of course._NEWLINE_<br/ Hmm. Was he a thief too?_NEWLINE_<br/ Uh… well, no. Actually, he had enough money to do anything that he wanted to do. He could go anywhere that he wanted to go. And, and, and for a kid with nothing, I don’t know, I… Just seemed like a better option._NEWLINE_<br/ Hmm._NEWLINE_<br/ You can’t tell anyone about this, okay? It could ruin my whole reputation._NEWLINE_<br/ Ah. We wouldn’t want that._NEWLINE_<br/ Well, a fake reputation is all a man has._NEWLINE_<br/ Hmm, hmm, hmm–_NEWLINE_<br/ Huh._NEWLINE_<br/ Hmm hmm._NEWLINE_<br/ Ahem. Well, I should, um… I, I should… I should get some more firewood._NEWLINE_<br/ Hey.<br/>For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert much better than Flynn Rider._NEWLINE_<br/ Well, then you’d be the first… but thank you._NEWLINE_<br/  Hmm._NEWLINE_<br/ Well! I thought he’d never leave!_NEWLINE_<br/ Mother!_NEWLINE_<br/ Hello dear._NEWLINE_<br/ But I, I, I, I don’t, uh… How did you find me?_NEWLINE_<br/ Oh, it was easy really. I just listened to the sound of complete and utter betrayal and followed that._NEWLINE_<br/  Mother…_NEWLINE_<br/ We’re going home, Rapunzel. Now._NEWLINE_<br/ You, you don’t understand. I’ve been on this incredible journey and I’ve seen and learned so much.<br/>I even met someone._NEWLINE_<br/ Yes, the wanted thief, I’m so proud. Come on, Rapunzel._NEWLINE_<br/ Mother, wait. I think…<br/>I think he likes me._NEWLINE_<br/ Likes you? Please, Rapunzel, that’s demented._NEWLINE_<br/ But mother, I…<br/>This is why you never should have left<br/><br/>Dear, this whole romance that you’ve invented<br/>Just proves you’re too naive to be here<br/>Why would he like you? Come on now, really.<br/>Look at you! You think that he’s impressed?<br/>Don’t be a dummy, come with mummy<br/>Mother…_NEWLINE_<br/ No!_NEWLINE_<br/ No?! Oh. I see how it is.<br/>Rapunzel knows best<br/>Rapunzel’s so mature now<br/>Such a clever grown-up miss<br/>Rapunzel knows best<br/>Fine, if you’re so sure now<br/>Go ahead, then give him this! _NEWLINE_<br/ How did you…?_NEWLINE_<br/ This  is why he’s here!<br/>Don’t let him deceive you!<br/>Give it to him, watch, you’ll see!_NEWLINE_<br/ I will!_NEWLINE_<br/ Trust me, my dear<br/>That’s how fast he’ll leave you<br/>I won’t say I told you so!<br/>No, Rapunzel knows best!<br/>So if he’s such a dreamboat<br/>Go and put him to the test_NEWLINE_<br/ Mother, wait–_NEWLINE_<br/ If he’s lying, don’t come crying,<br/>‘Mother knows best’! <br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ So…<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Hey uh… can I ask you something? Is there any chance that I’m gonna get super strength in my hand because I’m not gonna lie. That would be stupendous.<br/> Hey, you all right?_NEWLINE_<br/ Oh! Sorry, yes. Just, em, lost in thought, I guess._NEWLINE_<br/ I mean because here’s the thing. Superhuman good looks, I’ve always had them–born with it, but superhuman strength? Can you imagine the possibilities of this…?_NEWLINE_<br/  Patience boys. All good things to those who wait.<br/>—<br/><br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Zzz.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Uh-uh?<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Well, I hope you’re here to apologize.<br/>Aghhhh…!<br/><br/>No, no, no, put me down! Let me go! Let–me–go–!_NEWLINE_<br/ Release–him–<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Easy, boy, easy! Settle down! Whoa, whoa! Easy, boy, easy.<br/>Easy.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ That’s it.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Now sit.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Sit!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ What?_NEWLINE_<br/ Now drop the boot.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Drop it!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Aww, you are such a good boy! Yes you are. Ho-ho.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ You’re all tired from chasing the bad man all over the place?<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Excuse me?_NEWLINE_<br/ Nobody appreciates you, do they?<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Do they?<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Oh come on, he’s a bad horse!_NEWLINE_<br/ Oh, he’s nothing but a big sweetheart!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Isn’t that right? Maximus?_NEWLINE_<br/ You’ve got to be kidding me.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Look. Today is kind of the biggest day of my life, and the thing is, I need you not to get him arrested.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Just for twenty-four hours and then you can chase each other to your heart’s content, okay?<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ And it’s also my birthday. Just so you know.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Oom!<br/><br/>—<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Oh, oh, sorry!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Thank you!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ It’s for the lost princess.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/To the boats!<br/></p><p>_NEWLINE_<br/ Hey Max!<br/><br/>What?

What do I do then?_NEWLINE_<br/ Well, that’s the good part I guess. You get to go find a new dream._NEWLINE_<br/ Hmm.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ All those days watching from the windows<br/>All those years outside looking in<br/>All that time never even knowing<br/>Just how blind I’ve been<br/>Now I’m here, blinking in the starlight<br/>Now I’m here, suddenly I see<br/>Standing here, it’s all so clear<br/>I’m where I’m meant to be<br/>And at last I see the light<br/>And it’s like the fog has lifted<br/>And at last I see the light<br/>And it’s like the sky is new<br/>And it’s warm and real and bright<br/>And the world has somehow shifted<br/>All at once everything looks different<br/>Now that I see you<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Hmm.<br/>I have something for you, too.<br/><br/>I should have given it to you before, but I was just scared. And the thing is, I’m not scared anymore. You know what I mean?_NEWLINE_<br/  I’m starting to.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ All those days chasing down a daydream<br/>All those years living in a blur<br/>All that time never truly seeing<br/>Things the way they were<br/>Now she’s here, shining in the starlight<br/>Now she’s here, suddenly I know<br/>If she’s here, it’s crystal clear<br/>I’m where I meant to go<br/><br/>F, R: And at last, I see the light_NEWLINE_<br/ And it’s like the fog has lifted<br/>F, R: And at last, I see the light_NEWLINE_<br/ And it’s like the sky is new<br/>F, R: And it’s warm and real and bright<br/>And the world has somehow shifted<br/>All at once, everything is different<br/>Now that I see you<br/><br/>F, R: Now that I see you.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Is everything okay?_NEWLINE_<br/ Huh?<br/>Oh, yes, uh, huh.

There’s just something I have to take care of._NEWLINE_<br/ Okay._NEWLINE_<br/ I’ll be right back.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ It’s all right, Pascal.</p><_NEWLINE_p Ah, there you are. Huh. I’ve been searching everywhere for you guys since we got separated. Hey, the sideburns just coming in nice, huh? Gotta be excited about that.<br/>Hmm-mm. Anyhow, just wanted to say, I shouldn’t have split, the crown is all yours, I’ll miss ya, but I think it’s for the… best.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Holding out on us again, eh, Rider?_NEWLINE_<br/ What?_NEWLINE_<br/ We heard you found somethin’. Somethin’ much more valuable than a crown.<br/>We want her, instead.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Uh. I was starting to think you ran off with the crown and left me.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ He did._NEWLINE_<br/ What? No, he wouldn’t._NEWLINE_<br/ See for yourself.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Eugene. <br/>Eugene!_NEWLINE_<br/ Fair trade, a crown for the girl with the magic hair?<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ How much do you think someone would pay to stay young and healthy<br/>forever?<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ No, please–no!

And I saw them attack you and–oh my, let’s go, let’s go before they come too.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/  You were right, mum. You were right about everything._NEWLINE_<br/ I know, darling. I know.</p><p>_NEWLINE_<br/ Look!<br/>The crown._NEWLINE_<br/ Rapunzel.

It never happened. Now, wash up for dinner. I’m making hazelnut soup.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Huh. I really did try, Rapunzel. I tried to warn you what was out there. The world is dark and selfish and cruel. If it finds even the slightest ray of sunshine, it destroys it.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/  Agh! <br/>—_NEWLINE_<br/  How did you know about her? Tell me, now!_NEWLINE_<br/ It wasn’t us. It was the old lady._NEWLINE_<br/ Old lady…  Agh! Wait! No! Wait! You don’t understand, she’s in trouble!

Thank you. Uh. I feel maybe this whole time we’ve just been misunderstanding one another, and we’re really just–huh—<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ –Yeah, you’re right, we should go.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Max…<br/>Max…<br/>Max! Waaahhh…<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Okay Max, let’s see how fast you can run.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Rapunzel? Rapunzel, let down your hair!<br/><br/>Rapunzel, I thought I’d never see you again. Huh? _NEWLINE_<br/  Mm-mm, mm-mm!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Mm-mm! Mm…_NEWLINE_<br/ Now look what you’ve done, Rapunzel.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Mm…_NEWLINE_<br/ Oh, don’t worry, dear.

For every minute of the rest of my life I will<br/>fight! I will never stop trying to get away from you! <br/>But, if you let me save him, I will go with you._NEWLINE_<br/  No! No, Rapunzel!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ I’ll never run, I’ll never try to escape. Just let me heal him, and you and I will be together. Forever, just like you want. Everything will be the way it was. I promise.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Just like you want.<br/> Just let me heal him.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ In case you get any ideas about following us. _NEWLINE_<br/ Eu–Eugene!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Oh, I’m so sorry. Everything is gonna be okay–_NEWLINE_<br/ No, Rapunzel–_NEWLINE_<br/ I promise you. You have to trust me–_NEWLINE_<br/ No–_NEWLINE_<br/ Come on. Just breathe–_NEWLINE_<br/ I can’t let you do this._NEWLINE_<br/ But I can’t let you die._NEWLINE_<br/  But if you do this, …_NEWLINE_<br/ Shh, shh, shh…_NEWLINE_<br/ … then you…_NEWLINE_<br/ … shh, shh…_NEWLINE_<br/ … will die._NEWLINE_<br/ Hey. It’s gonna be all right.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Rapunzel, wait… _NEWLINE_<br/  Eugene, (what…?)_NEWLINE_<br/ No!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/  No, no, no…  no! What have you done? What have you done?  No!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Arghhh!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/  No, no, no, no, no, Eugene.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Oh. Look at me, look at me, I’m right here, don’t go, stay with me, Eugene–flower gleam and glow, let your power shine, make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine–_NEWLINE_<br/ –Rapunzel._NEWLINE_<br/ What?_NEWLINE_<br/ You were my new dream._NEWLINE_<br/  And you were mine.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Heal what has been hurt.

What once was mine.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Rapunzel._NEWLINE_<br/  Eugene._NEWLINE_<br/ Did I ever tell you I’ve got a thing for brunettes?_NEWLINE_<br/  Eugene!<br/><br/>—<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Whoa!<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Well, you could imagine what happened next.</p><p>The kingdom rejoiced, for the lost princess had now returned. The party lasted an entire week, and honestly I don’t remember much of it.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Dreams came true all over the place. That guy went on to become the most famous concert pianist in the world, if you can believe it.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ And this guy? Well, he eventually found true love.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ As for this guy, well, I assume he’s happy. He’s never told me otherwise.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Thanks to Maximus, crime in the kingdom disappeared almost overnight…<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ … as did most of the apples.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ Pascal–never changed.<br/>_NEWLINE_<br/ At last, Rapunzel was home and she finally had a real family. She was a Princess worth waiting for. Beloved by all, she led her kingdom with all the grace and wisdom that her parents did before her.<br/>And as for me, well, I started going by Eugene again. Stopped thieving and basically turned it all around, but I know what the big question is, hah.<br/>Did Rapunzel and I ever get married? Well I am pleased to tell you that after years and years of asking, and asking, and asking, I finally said yes._NEWLINE_<br/ Eugene._NEWLINE_<br/ All right, I asked her._NEWLINE_<br/ And we’re living happily ever after._NEWLINE_<br/ Yes we are.<br/><br/>—'"

It had the ability to heal the sick and injured.<br/>Oh, you see that old woman over there? You might want to remember<br/>her. She’s kind of important.</p><p>Well, centuries passed, and a hop skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom. The kingdom was ruled by a beloved King and Queen.<br/>And the Queen, (well,) she was about to have a baby. She got sick. Really, sick.<br/>She was running out of time, and that’s when people usually start to look for a miracle. Or in this case, a magic golden flower.</p><p>Ah, I told you she’d be important. You see, instead of sharing the sun’s gift, this woman, Mother Gothel, hoarded its healing power and used it to keep herself young for hundreds of years, and all she had to do was sing a special song._NEWLINE_G:_START Flower, gleam and glow<br/>Let your power shine<br/>Make the clock reverse<br/>Bring back what once was mine<br/>What once was mine_NEWLINE_F:_START All right, you get the gist.

And I can’t help but feel like they’re… they’re meant for me.<br/>I need to see them, mother, and not just from my window. In person.<br/>I have to know what they are._NEWLINE_G:_START You want to go outside?

You are not leaving this tower!<br/>Ever!<br/>_NEWLINE_G:_START Ugh, great. Now I’m the bad guy.<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START All I was gonna say, mother, is that, I know what I want for my birthday now._NEWLINE_G:_START And what is that?_NEWLINE_R:_START New paint. The paint made from the white shells you once brought me._NEWLINE_G:_START Well, that is a very long trip, Rapunzel. Almost three days’ time._NEWLINE_R:_START I just thought it was a better idea than… stars._NEWLINE_G:_START Ugh.<br/>You’re sure you’ll be all right on your own?_NEWLINE_R:_START I know I’m safe as long as I’m here._NEWLINE_G:_START <br/>I’ll be back in three days’ time.<br/>I love you very much, dear._NEWLINE_R:_START I love you more._NEWLINE_G:_START I love you most.<br/></p>_NEWLINE_R:_START  Okay.<br/><br/>Uh?<br/><br/>Hmm.<br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START Agh! Huh? Uh?  Is this hair?_NEWLINE_R:_START Struggling… struggling is pointless._NEWLINE_F:_START Huh?_NEWLINE_R:_START I know why you’re here, and I’m not afraid of you._NEWLINE_F:_START What?<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START Who are you? And how did you find me?_NEWLINE_F:_START Aha._NEWLINE_R:_START Who are you, and how did you find me?_NEWLINE_F:_START Mm-hm. I know not who you are, nor how I came to find you, but may<br/>I just say…<br/>Hi. How ya doin’? The name’s Flynn Rider. How’s your day goin’? Huh?_NEWLINE_R:_START Ugh!<br/>Who else knows my location, Flynn Rider?_NEWLINE_F:_START All right, blondie–_NEWLINE_R:_START Rapunzel._NEWLINE_F:_START Gesundheit. Here’s the deal.<br/>I was in a situation, gallivanting through the forest. I came across your tower and… ho, oh no… where is my satchel?_NEWLINE_R:_START I’ve hidden it, somewhere you’ll never find it._NEWLINE_F:_START It’s in that pot, isn’t it?<br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START Er, uh. Huh? <br/>Yike!  Would you stop that?_NEWLINE_R:_START Now it’s hidden where you’ll never find it.<br/>So, what do you want with my hair? To cut it?_NEWLINE_F:_START What?_NEWLINE_R:_START Sell it?_NEWLINE_F:_START No! Listen, the only thing I want to do with your hair is to get<br/>out of it. Literally._NEWLINE_R:_START Yi. Wait. You don’t want my hair?_NEWLINE_F:_START Why on earth would I want your hair? Look, I was being chased, I<br/>saw a tower, I climbed it, end of story._NEWLINE_R:_START You’re… telling the truth?_NEWLINE_F:_START Yes.<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START I know, I need someone to take me.<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START I think he’s telling the truth, too.<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START (He) doesn’t have fangs, but what choice do I have?<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START Huh. Okay, Flynn Rider, I’m prepared to offer you a deal._NEWLINE_F:_START Deal?_NEWLINE_R:_START Look this way.<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START Do you know what these are?_NEWLINE_F:_START You mean the lantern thing they do for the princess?_NEWLINE_R:_START Lanterns. I knew they weren’t stars.<br/>Well, tomorrow evening they will light the night sky with these lanterns.<br/>You will act as my guide, take me to these lanterns, and return me home safely. Then, and only then, will I return your satchel to you. That is my deal._NEWLINE_F:_START Yeah. No can do. Unfortunately, the kingdom and I aren’t exactly ‘simpatico’ at the moment. So I won’t be taking you anywhere.<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START Something brought you here, Flynn Rider. Call it what you will: fate, destiny…_NEWLINE_F:_START A horse._NEWLINE_R:_START So I have made the decision to trust you._NEWLINE_F:_START A horrible decision, really._NEWLINE_R:_START But trust me when I tell you this.<br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START Ugh!<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START You can tear this tower apart brick by brick, but without my help, you will never find your precious satchel._NEWLINE_F:_START Hmm-mm. Let me just get this straight. I take you to see the lanterns, bring you back home, and you’ll give me back my satchel?_NEWLINE_R:_START I promise.<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START And when I promise something, I never ever break that promise.<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START Ever.<br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START All right, listen, I didn’t want to have to do this, but you leave me no choice. Here comes the ‘smoulder’.<br/><br/>This is kind of an off day for me. This doesn’t normally happen.<br/>… Fine, I’ll take you to see the lanterns!_NEWLINE_R:_START Really?<br/>Oops._NEWLINE_F:_START You broke my ‘smoulder’.</p>_NEWLINE_F:_START You comin’, blondie?<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START Look at the world so close, and I’m halfway to it!<br/>Look at it all so big, do I even dare?<br/>Look at me, there at last! I just have to do it<br/>Should I? No. Here I go…<br/><br/>Just smell the grass! The dirt! Just like I dreamed they’d be!<br/>Just feel that summer breeze, the way it’s calling me<br/>For like the first time ever, I’m completely free!<br/>I could go running, and racing, and dancing, and chasing<br/>And leaping, and bounding, hair flying, heart pounding<br/>And splashing, and reeling, and finally feeling<br/>That’s when my life begins!<br/><br/>I can’t believe I did this.<br/>*I can’t believe I did this.*<br/>I can’t believe I did this! Haha.<br/>*Mother would be so furious.*<br/>That’s okay! I mean, what she doesn’t know won’t kill her, right?<br/>*Oh my gosh, this would kill her.*<br/>This is so fun!<br/>*I am a horrible daughter. I’m going back.*<br/>I am never going back! Woo-hoo!<br/>*I am a despicable human being.*<br/>Woo-hoo! Best. Day. Ever!<br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START Hmm-mm-m.<br/>You know, I can’t help but notice you seem a little at war with yourself here._NEWLINE_R:_START  What?_NEWLINE_F:_START Now, I’m only picking up bits and pieces, of course. Overprotective mother, forbidden road trip. I mean, this is serious stuff. But let me ease your conscience.<br/>This is part of growing up. A little rebellion, a little adventure–that’s good, healthy even!_NEWLINE_R:_START You think?_NEWLINE_F:_START I know. You’re way over-thinking this, trust me. Does your mother deserve it? No. Would this break her heart and crush her soul? Of course. But you just got to do it._NEWLINE_R:_START ‘Break her heart?’_NEWLINE_F:_START In half._NEWLINE_R:_START ‘Crush her soul?’_NEWLINE_F:_START  Like a grape._NEWLINE_R:_START She would be heartbroken, you’re right._NEWLINE_F:_START I am, aren’t I? Oh bother.<br/>All right, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m letting you out of the deal._NEWLINE_R:_START What?_NEWLINE_F:_START That’s right. But don’t thank me. Let’s just turn around and get you home (/find your pan)–and your frog–I get back my satchel, you get back a mother-daughter relationship based on mutual trust and voila! We part ways as unlikely friends._NEWLINE_R:_START No! I am seeing those lanterns–_NEWLINE_F:_START Oh come on! What is it going to take to get my satchel back?_NEWLINE_R:_START I will use this.<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START  Is it ruffians? Thugs? Have they come for me?<br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START Stay calm. It can probably smell fear._NEWLINE_R:_START Oh, huh, sorry. Guess I’m just a little bit… jumpy._NEWLINE_F:_START Probably be best if we avoid ruffians and thugs, though._NEWLINE_R:_START Uh-huh, yeah, that’d probably be best._NEWLINE_F:_START  Are you hungry? I know a great place for lunch._NEWLINE_R:_START Oh.<br/>Where?_NEWLINE_F:_START Oh don’t you worry. You’ll know it when you smell it.<br/>—<br/>_NEWLINE_G:_START Huh!<br/>_NEWLINE_G:_START Uh, a Palace horse. Where’s your rider? Rapunzel.<br/>RAPUNZEL!<br/>_NEWLINE_G:_START Rapunzel, let down your hair!<br/>_NEWLINE_G:_START Rapunzel?<br/><br/>Rapunzel?<br/><br/>RAPUNZEL!<br/><br/>—_NEWLINE_F:_START I know it’s around here, somewhere.<br/>Ah, there it is, the Snuggly Duckling.<br/>Don’t worry, very quaint place, perfect for you. Don’t want you scaring and giving up on this whole endeavour now do we?_NEWLINE_R:_START Well, I do like duckling._NEWLINE_F:_START YAY!</p><p>_NEWLINE_F:_START Garcon, your finest table please!<br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START You smell that? Take a deep breath through the nose.<br/> Really let that seep in._NEWLINE_R:_START Agh!_NEWLINE_F:_START What are you getting? Because to me,…_NEWLINE_R:_START Agh!_NEWLINE_F:_START … that’s part man-smell, and the other part is really bad man-smell. I don’t know why, but overall  it just smells like the color brown. Your thoughts?<br/>_NEWLINE_Thug:_START That’s a lot of hair._NEWLINE_F:_START She’s growing it out. Is that blood in your moustache? Goldie, look at this. Look at all the blood in his moustache.<br/>That, sir, that’s a lot of blood.<br/>Hey, you don’t look so good, blondie. Maybe we should get you a home. Call it a day.<br/>Probably be better off. This is a five star joint after all, and if you can’t handle this place, well, maybe you should be back in your tower.<br/>_NEWLINE_Vlad:_START Is this you?<br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START Aw. Now they’re just being mean._NEWLINE_Hook:_START Ho, ho, it’s him all right. Greno, go find some guards! That reward’s going to buy me a new hook._NEWLINE_Attila:_START I could use the money._NEWLINE_Vlad:_START What about me? I’m broke.<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START Please, stop!_NEWLINE_F:_START We can work this out._NEWLINE_R:_START Please, leave him alone!_NEWLINE_F:_START Gentlemen, please!_NEWLINE_R:_START Give me back my guide!<br/>Ruffians!_NEWLINE_F:_START  Not the nose, not the nose, not the nose!_NEWLINE_R:_START Put him down!<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START Whoa! Okay, I don’t know where I am, and I need him to take me to see the lanterns because I’ve been dreaming about them my entire life! Find your humanity! Haven’t any of you ever had a dream?<br/>_NEWLINE_Hook:_START I had a dream… once.<br/>_NEWLINE_Hook:_START I’m malicious, mean and scary<br/>My sneer could curdle dairy<br/>And violence-wise, my hands are not the cleanest<br/>But despite my evil look<br/>And my temper and my hook<br/>I’ve always yearned to be a concert pianist<br/><br/>Can’tcha see me on the stage performin’ Mozart?<br/>Tickling the ivories ’til they gleam?<br/>Yep, I’d rather be called deadly<br/>For my killer show-tune medley<br/>–Thank you!<br/>‘Cause way down deep inside I’ve got a dream_NEWLINE_Thugs:_START He’s got a dream!

Flower gleam and glow, let your power shine…_NEWLINE_F:_START  Whoa!<br/></p><p>_NEWLINE_R:_START We made it._NEWLINE_F:_START Her hair glows._NEWLINE_R:_START I’m alive. I’m alive!_NEWLINE_F:_START I didn’t see that coming._NEWLINE_R:_START Eugene._NEWLINE_F:_START Her hair actually glows._NEWLINE_R:_START Eugene._NEWLINE_F:_START Why does her hair glow?_NEWLINE_R:_START Eugene!_NEWLINE_F:_START What?_NEWLINE_R:_START It doesn’t just glow._NEWLINE_F:_START Why is he  smiling at me?<br/>—_NEWLINE_St:_START I’ll kill ‘im. I’ll kill that Rider!<br/>We’ll cut him off at the kingdom, and get back the crown. C’mon!_NEWLINE_G:_START Boys!<br/>_NEWLINE_G:_START Perhaps you want to stop acting like wild dogs chasing their tails and think for a moment.<br/>_NEWLINE_G:_START Oh-ho, please, there’s no need for that.<br/>_NEWLINE_G:_START Well, if that’s all that you desire then be on your way. I was going to offer you something worth one thousand crowns, would have made you rich beyond belief and that wasn’t even the best part, hoho, oh well,<br/>c’est la vie. Enjoy your crown._NEWLINE_St:_START What’s the best part?_NEWLINE_G:_START It comes with revenge on Flynn Rider.<br/>—_NEWLINE_F:_START So you’re being strangely cryptic as you wrap your magic hair around my injured hand.<br/>Agh!_NEWLINE_R:_START Sorry.  Just don’t… don’t freak out.<br/><br/>Flower, gleam and glow<br/>Let your power shine<br/>Make the clock reverse<br/>Bring back what once was mine<br/><br/>Heal what has been hurt<br/>Change the fate’s design<br/>Save what has been lost<br/>Bring back what once was mine<br/><br/>What once was mine_NEWLINE_F:_START _NEWLINE_R:_START (Please) don’t freak out!<br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START Arrrr.

They wanted to take it for themselves. But, once it’s cut, it turns brown and loses its power. A gift like that, it has to be protected. That’s why mother never let me…  That’s why I never left the… hmm._NEWLINE_F:_START … You never left that tower.<br/><br/>And you’re still gonna go back?_NEWLINE_R:_START No! Yes. Ugh! It’s complicated.<br/>Hah. So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?_NEWLINE_F:_START Uh, yeah. Well. I’ll spare you the sob story of poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert, it’s a little bit of a… that’s a little bit of a downer.<br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START Huh.<br/>There was this book, a book I used to read every night to all the younger kids – ‘The Tales of Flynnigan Rider’. Swashbuckling rogue, richest man alive, not bad with the ladies, either. Not that he would to brag about it, of course._NEWLINE_R:_START Hmm. Was he a thief too?_NEWLINE_F:_START Uh… well, no. Actually, he had enough money to do anything that he wanted to do. He could go anywhere that he wanted to go. And, and, and for a kid with nothing, I don’t know, I… Just seemed like a better option._NEWLINE_R:_START Hmm._NEWLINE_F:_START You can’t tell anyone about this, okay? It could ruin my whole reputation._NEWLINE_R:_START Ah. We wouldn’t want that._NEWLINE_F:_START Well, a fake reputation is all a man has._NEWLINE_R:_START Hmm, hmm, hmm–_NEWLINE_F:_START Huh._NEWLINE_R:_START Hmm hmm._NEWLINE_F:_START Ahem. Well, I should, um… I, I should… I should get some more firewood._NEWLINE_R:_START Hey.<br/>For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert much better than Flynn Rider._NEWLINE_F:_START Well, then you’d be the first… but thank you._NEWLINE_R:_START  Hmm._NEWLINE_G:_START Well! I thought he’d never leave!_NEWLINE_R:_START Mother!_NEWLINE_G:_START Hello dear._NEWLINE_R:_START But I, I, I, I don’t, uh… How did you find me?_NEWLINE_G:_START Oh, it was easy really. I just listened to the sound of complete and utter betrayal and followed that._NEWLINE_R:_START  Mother…_NEWLINE_G:_START We’re going home, Rapunzel. Now._NEWLINE_R:_START You, you don’t understand. I’ve been on this incredible journey and I’ve seen and learned so much.<br/>I even met someone._NEWLINE_G:_START Yes, the wanted thief, I’m so proud. Come on, Rapunzel._NEWLINE_R:_START Mother, wait. I think…<br/>I think he likes me._NEWLINE_G:_START Likes you? Please, Rapunzel, that’s demented._NEWLINE_R:_START But mother, I…<br/>This is why you never should have left<br/><br/>Dear, this whole romance that you’ve invented<br/>Just proves you’re too naive to be here<br/>Why would he like you? Come on now, really.<br/>Look at you! You think that he’s impressed?<br/>Don’t be a dummy, come with mummy<br/>Mother…_NEWLINE_R:_START No!_NEWLINE_G:_START No?! Oh. I see how it is.<br/>Rapunzel knows best<br/>Rapunzel’s so mature now<br/>Such a clever grown-up miss<br/>Rapunzel knows best<br/>Fine, if you’re so sure now<br/>Go ahead, then give him this! _NEWLINE_R:_START How did you…?_NEWLINE_G:_START This  is why he’s here!<br/>Don’t let him deceive you!<br/>Give it to him, watch, you’ll see!_NEWLINE_R:_START I will!_NEWLINE_G:_START Trust me, my dear<br/>That’s how fast he’ll leave you<br/>I won’t say I told you so!<br/>No, Rapunzel knows best!<br/>So if he’s such a dreamboat<br/>Go and put him to the test_NEWLINE_R:_START Mother, wait–_NEWLINE_G:_START If he’s lying, don’t come crying,<br/>‘Mother knows best’! <br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START So…<br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START Hey uh… can I ask you something? Is there any chance that I’m gonna get super strength in my hand because I’m not gonna lie. That would be stupendous.<br/> Hey, you all right?_NEWLINE_R:_START Oh! Sorry, yes. Just, em, lost in thought, I guess._NEWLINE_F:_START I mean because here’s the thing. Superhuman good looks, I’ve always had them–born with it, but superhuman strength? Can you imagine the possibilities of this…?_NEWLINE_G:_START  Patience boys. All good things to those who wait.<br/>—<br/><br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START Zzz.<br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START Uh-uh?<br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START Well, I hope you’re here to apologize.<br/>Aghhhh…!<br/><br/>No, no, no, put me down!

Yes you are. Ho-ho.<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START You’re all tired from chasing the bad man all over the place?<br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START Excuse me?_NEWLINE_R:_START Nobody appreciates you, do they?<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START Do they?<br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START Oh come on, he’s a bad horse!_NEWLINE_R:_START Oh, he’s nothing but a big sweetheart!<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START Isn’t that right? Maximus?_NEWLINE_F:_START You’ve got to be kidding me.<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START Look. Today is kind of the biggest day of my life, and the thing is, I need you not to get him arrested.<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START Just for twenty-four hours and then you can chase each other to your heart’s content, okay?<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START And it’s also my birthday. Just so you know.<br/>_NEWLINE_F:_START Oom!<br/><br/>—<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START Oh, oh, sorry!<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START Thank you!<br/>_NEWLINE_Girl:_START It’s for the lost princess.<br/>_NEWLINE_Citizen:_STARTTo the boats!<br/></p><p>_NEWLINE_F:_START Hey Max!<br/><br/>What?

What do I do then?_NEWLINE_F:_START Well, that’s the good part I guess. You get to go find a new dream._NEWLINE_R:_START Hmm.<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START All those days watching from the windows<br/>All those years outside looking in<br/>All that time never even knowing<br/>Just how blind I’ve been<br/>Now I’m here, blinking in the starlight<br/>Now I’m here, suddenly I see<br/>Standing here, it’s all so clear<br/>I’m where I’m meant to be<br/>And at last I see the light<br/>And it’s like the fog has lifted<br/>And at last I see the light<br/>And it’s like the sky is new<br/>And it’s warm and real and bright<br/>And the world has somehow shifted<br/>All at once everything looks different<br/>Now that I see you<br/>_NEWLINE_R:_START Hmm.<br/>I have something for you, too.<br/><br/>I should have given it to you before, but I was just scared.

       "'—_NEWLINE_F:_START This is the story of how I died. Don’t worry, this is actually a very fun story and the truth is, it isn’t even mine. This is the story of a girl named Rapunzel and it starts with the sun.  Now, once upon a time, a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens and from this small drop of sun, grew a magic, golden flower. It had the ability to heal the sick and injured. Oh, you see that old woman over there? You might want to remember her. She’s kind of important.  Well, centuries passed, and a hop skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom. The kingdom was ruled by a beloved King and Queen. And the Queen, (well,) she was about to have a baby. She got sick. Really, sick. She was running out of time, and that’s when people usually start to look for a miracle. Or in this case, a magic golden flower.  Ah, I told you she’d be important. You see, instead of sharing the sun’s gift, this woman, Mother Gothel, hoarded its healing power and used it to keep herself young for hundreds of years, and all she had to do was sing a special song._NEWLINE_G:_START Flower, gleam and glow Let your power shine Make the clock reverse Bring back what once was mine What once was mine_NEWLINE_F:_START All right, you get the gist. She sings to it, she turns young, creepy, right?_NEWLINE_Guards:_START We’ve found it! _NEWLINE_F:_START The magic of the golden flower healed the queen. A healthy baby girl, a princess was born, with beautiful golden hair. I’ll give you a hint: that’s Rapunzel. To celebrate her birth, the King and Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky. And for that one moment, everything was perfect.  And then that moment ended._NEWLINE_G:_START Flower, gleam and glow Let your power shine Make the clock re- _NEWLINE_F:_START Gothel broke into the castle, stole the child and just like that– gone.  The kingdom searched and searched but they could not find the princess. For deep within the forest, in a hidden tower, Gothel raised the child as her own._NEWLINE_Young R:_START(Heal what has been hurt) (Change the fate’s design) Save what has been lost Bring back what once was mine What once was mine_NEWLINE_F:_START Gothel had found her new magic flower, but this time she was determined to keep it hidden._NEWLINE_Young R:_START Why can’t I go outside?_NEWLINE_G:_START The outside world is a dangerous place, filled with horrible, selfish people. You must stay here, where you’re safe. Do you understand, flower?_NEWLINE_Young R:_STARTYes mommy. _NEWLINE_F:_START But the walls of that tower could not hide everything. Each year, on her birthday, the King and Queen released thousands of lanterns into the sky, in hope that one day, their lost princess would return.  —  _NEWLINE_R:_START Ha! Hmm. Well, I guess Pascal’s not hiding out here… _NEWLINE_R:_START Gotcha! That’s twenty-two for me. How about twenty-three out of forty-five? _NEWLINE_R:_START Okay, well, what do you wanna do? _NEWLINE_R:_START Yeah, I don’t think so. I like it in here and so do you. _NEWLINE_R:_START Oh come on Pascal, it’s not so bad in there…  Seven a.m., the usual morning lineup Start up the chores and sweep till the floor’s all clean Polish and wax, do laundry, and mop and shine up Sweep again, and by then it’s, like, seven-fifteen And so I’ll read a book or maybe two or three I’ll add a few new paintings to my gallery I’ll play guitar and knit and cook and basically Just wonder when will my life begin?  Then after lunch it’s puzzles and darts and baking Papier-mache, a bit of ballet and chess Pottery and ventriloquy, candle-making Then I’ll stretch, maybe sketch, take a climb, sew a dress! And I’ll re-read the books if I have time to spare I’ll paint the walls some more, I’m sure there’s room somewhere And then I’ll brush and brush and brush and brush my hair Stuck in the same place I’ve always been And I’ll keep wondering and wondering and wondering and wondering When will my life begin?  Tomorrow night, the lights will appear Just like they do on my birthday each year What is it like out there where they glow? Now that I’m older, Mother might just let me go… —_NEWLINE_F:_START Wow! I could get used to a view like this._NEWLINE_St:_START Rider! C’mon!_NEWLINE_F:_START Hold on. Yup. I’m used to it. Guys I want a castle._NEWLINE_St:_START We do this job. You can buy your own castle. _NEWLINE_F:_START Oh. Hay fever?_NEWLINE_Guard:_START Yea.  Huh? Hey, wait. Hey, wait!_NEWLINE_F:_START Can’t you picture me in a castle of my own? Coz I certainly can. All the things we’ve seen and it’s only eight in the morning (0800). Gentlemen this is a very big day! —_NEWLINE_R:_START This is it. This is a very big day, Pascal. Hmm-mm. I’m finally gonna do it. I’m gonna ask her._NEWLINE_G:_START  Rapunzel! _NEWLINE_G:_START Let down your hair!_NEWLINE_R:_START It’s time.  I know, I know, come on, don’t let her see you._NEWLINE_G:_START  Rapunzel, I’m not getting any younger down here._NEWLINE_R:_START Coming, mother!  Hi. Welcome home, mother._NEWLINE_G:_START Uh, Rapunzel! How you manage to do that every single day without fail! It looks absolutely exhausting, darling._NEWLINE_R:_START Oh, it’s nothing._NEWLINE_G:_START Then I don’t know why it takes so long! Ergh, ho-ho-ho-ho, darling, I’m just teasing._NEWLINE_R:_START Hmm, he-he-he. Alright, so, mother, as you know, tomorrow is a very big day–_NEWLINE_G:_START Rapunzel, look in that mirror. You know what I see? I see a strong, confident, beautiful young lady. Oh look, you’re here too. Er-ha-ha-ha-ha, I’m just teasing!

I need to see them, mother, and not just from my window. In person. I have to know what they are._NEWLINE_G:_START You want to go outside? Why, Rapunzel!

You are not leaving this tower! Ever! _NEWLINE_G:_START Ugh, great. Now I’m the bad guy. _NEWLINE_R:_START All I was gonna say, mother, is that, I know what I want for my birthday now._NEWLINE_G:_START And what is that?_NEWLINE_R:_START New paint. The paint made from the white shells you once brought me._NEWLINE_G:_START Well, that is a very long trip, Rapunzel. Almost three days’ time._NEWLINE_R:_START I just thought it was a better idea than… stars._NEWLINE_G:_START Ugh. You’re sure you’ll be all right on your own?_NEWLINE_R:_START I know I’m safe as long as I’m here._NEWLINE_G:_START  I’ll be back in three days’ time. I love you very much, dear._NEWLINE_R:_START I love you more._NEWLINE_G:_START I love you most.  _NEWLINE_R:_START  Okay.  Uh?  Hmm. _NEWLINE_F:_START Agh! Huh? Uh?  Is this hair?_NEWLINE_R:_START Struggling… struggling is pointless._NEWLINE_F:_START Huh?_NEWLINE_R:_START I know why you’re here, and I’m not afraid of you._NEWLINE_F:_START What? _NEWLINE_R:_START Who are you? And how did you find me?_NEWLINE_F:_START Aha._NEWLINE_R:_START Who are you, and how did you find me?_NEWLINE_F:_START Mm-hm. I know not who you are, nor how I came to find you, but may I just say… Hi. How ya doin’? The name’s Flynn Rider. How’s your day goin’? Huh?_NEWLINE_R:_START Ugh! Who else knows my location, Flynn Rider?_NEWLINE_F:_START All right, blondie–_NEWLINE_R:_START Rapunzel._NEWLINE_F:_START Gesundheit. Here’s the deal. I was in a situation, gallivanting through the forest. I came across your tower and… ho, oh no… where is my satchel?_NEWLINE_R:_START I’ve hidden it, somewhere you’ll never find it._NEWLINE_F:_START It’s in that pot, isn’t it? _NEWLINE_F:_START Er, uh. Huh?  Yike!  Would you stop that?_NEWLINE_R:_START Now it’s hidden where you’ll never find it. So, what do you want with my hair? To cut it?_NEWLINE_F:_START What?_NEWLINE_R:_START Sell it?_NEWLINE_F:_START No! Listen, the only thing I want to do with your hair is to get out of it. Literally._NEWLINE_R:_START Yi. Wait. You don’t want my hair?_NEWLINE_F:_START Why on earth would I want your hair? Look, I was being chased, I saw a tower, I climbed it, end of story._NEWLINE_R:_START You’re… telling the truth?_NEWLINE_F:_START Yes. _NEWLINE_R:_START I know, I need someone to take me. _NEWLINE_R:_START I think he’s telling the truth, too. _NEWLINE_R:_START (He) doesn’t have fangs, but what choice do I have? _NEWLINE_R:_START Huh. Okay, Flynn Rider, I’m prepared to offer you a deal._NEWLINE_F:_START Deal?_NEWLINE_R:_START Look this way. _NEWLINE_R:_START Do you know what these are?_NEWLINE_F:_START You mean the lantern thing they do for the princess?_NEWLINE_R:_START Lanterns. I knew they weren’t stars. Well, tomorrow evening they will light the night sky with these lanterns. You will act as my guide, take me to these lanterns, and return me home safely. Then, and only then, will I return your satchel to you. That is my deal._NEWLINE_F:_START Yeah. No can do. Unfortunately, the kingdom and I aren’t exactly ‘simpatico’ at the moment. So I won’t be taking you anywhere. _NEWLINE_R:_START Something brought you here, Flynn Rider. Call it what you will: fate, destiny…_NEWLINE_F:_START A horse._NEWLINE_R:_START So I have made the decision to trust you._NEWLINE_F:_START A horrible decision, really._NEWLINE_R:_START But trust me when I tell you this. _NEWLINE_F:_START Ugh! _NEWLINE_R:_START You can tear this tower apart brick by brick, but without my help, you will never find your precious satchel._NEWLINE_F:_START Hmm-mm. Let me just get this straight. I take you to see the lanterns, bring you back home, and you’ll give me back my satchel?_NEWLINE_R:_START I promise. _NEWLINE_R:_START And when I promise something, I never ever break that promise. _NEWLINE_R:_START Ever. _NEWLINE_F:_START All right, listen, I didn’t want to have to do this, but you leave me no choice. Here comes the ‘smoulder’.  This is kind of an off day for me. This doesn’t normally happen. … Fine, I’ll take you to see the lanterns!_NEWLINE_R:_START Really? Oops._NEWLINE_F:_START You broke my ‘smoulder’. _NEWLINE_F:_START You comin’, blondie? _NEWLINE_R:_START Look at the world so close, and I’m halfway to it! Look at it all so big, do I even dare? Look at me, there at last! I just have to do it Should I? No. Here I go…  Just smell the grass! The dirt! Just like I dreamed they’d be! Just feel that summer breeze, the way it’s calling me For like the first time ever, I’m completely free! I could go running, and racing, and dancing, and chasing And leaping, and bounding, hair flying, heart pounding And splashing, and reeling, and finally feeling That’s when my life begins!  I can’t believe I did this. *I can’t believe I did this.* I can’t believe I did this! Haha. *Mother would be so furious.* That’s okay! I mean, what she doesn’t know won’t kill her, right? *Oh my gosh, this would kill her.* This is so fun! *I am a horrible daughter. I’m going back.* I am never going back! Woo-hoo! *I am a despicable human being.* Woo-hoo! Best. Day. Ever! _NEWLINE_F:_START Hmm-mm-m. You know, I can’t help but notice you seem a little at war with yourself here._NEWLINE_R:_START  What?_NEWLINE_F:_START Now, I’m only picking up bits and pieces, of course. Overprotective mother, forbidden road trip. I mean, this is serious stuff. But let me ease your conscience. This is part of growing up. A little rebellion, a little adventure–that’s good, healthy even!_NEWLINE_R:_START You think?_NEWLINE_F:_START I know. You’re way over-thinking this, trust me. Does your mother deserve it? No. Would this break her heart and crush her soul? Of course. But you just got to do it._NEWLINE_R:_START ‘Break her heart?’_NEWLINE_F:_START In half._NEWLINE_R:_START ‘Crush her soul?’_NEWLINE_F:_START  Like a grape._NEWLINE_R:_START She would be heartbroken, you’re right._NEWLINE_F:_START I am, aren’t I? Oh bother. All right, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m letting you out of the deal._NEWLINE_R:_START What?_NEWLINE_F:_START That’s right. But don’t thank me. Let’s just turn around and get you home (/find your pan)–and your frog–I get back my satchel, you get back a mother-daughter relationship based on mutual trust and voila! We part ways as unlikely friends._NEWLINE_R:_START No! I am seeing those lanterns–_NEWLINE_F:_START Oh come on! What is it going to take to get my satchel back?_NEWLINE_R:_START I will use this. _NEWLINE_R:_START  Is it ruffians? Thugs? Have they come for me? _NEWLINE_F:_START Stay calm. It can probably smell fear._NEWLINE_R:_START Oh, huh, sorry. Guess I’m just a little bit… jumpy._NEWLINE_F:_START Probably be best if we avoid ruffians and thugs, though._NEWLINE_R:_START Uh-huh, yeah, that’d probably be best._NEWLINE_F:_START  Are you hungry? I know a great place for lunch._NEWLINE_R:_START Oh. Where?_NEWLINE_F:_START Oh don’t you worry. You’ll know it when you smell it. — _NEWLINE_G:_START Huh! _NEWLINE_G:_START Uh, a Palace horse. Where’s your rider? Rapunzel. RAPUNZEL! _NEWLINE_G:_START Rapunzel, let down your hair! _NEWLINE_G:_START Rapunzel?  Rapunzel?  RAPUNZEL!  —_NEWLINE_F:_START I know it’s around here, somewhere. Ah, there it is, the Snuggly Duckling. Don’t worry, very quaint place, perfect for you. Don’t want you scaring and giving up on this whole endeavour now do we?_NEWLINE_R:_START Well, I do like duckling._NEWLINE_F:_START YAY!  _NEWLINE_F:_START Garcon, your finest table please! _NEWLINE_F:_START You smell that? Take a deep breath through the nose.  Really let that seep in._NEWLINE_R:_START Agh!_NEWLINE_F:_START What are you getting? Because to me,…_NEWLINE_R:_START Agh!_NEWLINE_F:_START … that’s part man-smell, and the other part is really bad man-smell. I don’t know why, but overall  it just smells like the color brown. Your thoughts? _NEWLINE_Thug:_START That’s a lot of hair._NEWLINE_F:_START She’s growing it out. Is that blood in your moustache? Goldie, look at this. Look at all the blood in his moustache. That, sir, that’s a lot of blood. Hey, you don’t look so good, blondie. Maybe we should get you a home. Call it a day. Probably be better off. This is a five star joint after all, and if you can’t handle this place, well, maybe you should be back in your tower. _NEWLINE_Vlad:_START Is this you? _NEWLINE_F:_START Aw. Now they’re just being mean._NEWLINE_Hook:_START Ho, ho, it’s him all right. Greno, go find some guards! That reward’s going to buy me a new hook._NEWLINE_Attila:_START I could use the money._NEWLINE_Vlad:_START What about me? I’m broke. _NEWLINE_R:_START Please, stop!_NEWLINE_F:_START We can work this out._NEWLINE_R:_START Please, leave him alone!_NEWLINE_F:_START Gentlemen, please!_NEWLINE_R:_START Give me back my guide! Ruffians!_NEWLINE_F:_START  Not the nose, not the nose, not the nose!_NEWLINE_R:_START Put him down! _NEWLINE_R:_START Whoa! Okay, I don’t know where I am, and I need him to take me to see the lanterns because I’ve been dreaming about them my entire life! Find your humanity! Haven’t any of you ever had a dream? _NEWLINE_Hook:_START I had a dream… once. _NEWLINE_Hook:_START I’m malicious, mean and scary My sneer could curdle dairy And violence-wise, my hands are not the cleanest But despite my evil look And my temper and my hook I’ve always yearned to be a concert pianist  Can’tcha see me on the stage performin’ Mozart? Tickling the ivories ’til they gleam? Yep, I’d rather be called deadly For my killer show-tune medley –Thank you! ‘Cause way down deep inside I’ve got a dream_NEWLINE_Thugs:_START He’s got a dream! He’s got a dream!_NEWLINE_Hook:_START See, I ain’t as cruel and vicious as I seem! Though I do like breaking femurs, you can count me with the dreamers Like everybody else, I’ve got a dream!  _NEWLINE_Big:_START I’ve got scars and lumps and bruises Plus something here that oozes And let’s not even mention my complexion But despite my extra toes And my goiter and my nose I really want to make a love connection  Can’t you see me with a special little lady Rowing in a rowboat down the stream? Though I’m one disgusting blighter, I’m a lover, not a fighter ‘Cause way down deep inside I’ve got a dream!  I’ve got a dream!_NEWLINE_Thugs:_START He’s got a dream!_NEWLINE_Big:_START I’ve got a dream!_NEWLINE_Thugs:_START He’s got a dream! And I know one day romance will reign supreme! Though my face leaves people screaming There’s a child behind it dreaming Like everybody else, I’ve got a dream_NEWLINE_Thugs:_START Tor would like to quit and be a florist Gunther does interior design Ulf is into mime, Attila’s cupcakes are sublime Bruiser knits, Killer sews, Fang does little puppet shows_NEWLINE_Hook:_START And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns  What about you?_NEWLINE_F:_START I’m sorry, me?_NEWLINE_Big:_START What’s your dream?_NEWLINE_F:_START No, no, no. Sorry boys, I don’t sing.  I have dreams, like you, no, really Just much less touchy-feely They mainly happen somewhere warm and sunny On an island that I own, tanned and rested and alone Surrounded by enormous piles of money _NEWLINE_R:_START I’ve got a dream!_NEWLINE_Thugs:_START She’s got a dream!_NEWLINE_R:_START I’ve got a dream!_NEWLINE_Thugs:_START She’s got a dream!_NEWLINE_R:_START I just want to see the floating lanterns gleam!_NEWLINE_Thugs:_START Yeahh!_NEWLINE_R:_START And with every passing hour _NEWLINE_R:_START I’m so glad I left my tower Like all you lovely folks, I’ve got a dream_NEWLINE_Thugs:_START She’s got a dream! He’s got a dream! They’ve got a dream! We’ve got a dream! So our diff’rences ain’t really that extreme–we’re one big team– Call us brutal, sick_NEWLINE_Hook:_START Sadistic_NEWLINE_Big:_START And grotesquely optimistic_NEWLINE_Thugs:_START ‘Cause way down deep inside we’ve got a dream!_NEWLINE_Hook:_START I’ve got a dream!_NEWLINE_Big:_START I’ve got a dream!_NEWLINE_Thug Chorus:_START I’ve got a dream!

I was talking to her._NEWLINE_R:_START Thanks for everything.  _NEWLINE_Vlad:_START I believe this is the man you’re looking for._NEWLINE_Shorty:_START You got me._NEWLINE_Guard:_START Sir, there’s no sign of Rider. _NEWLINE_Capt:_START Maximus. _NEWLINE_Guard:_START What’s he doing? _NEWLINE_Capt:_START A passage.

I know. So, Flynn, where’re you from?_NEWLINE_F:_START Whoo-oo! Sorry, blondie, I don’t do back-story. However I am becoming very interested in yours. Now I, I know I’m not supposed to mention the hair._NEWLINE_R:_START Nope._NEWLINE_F:_START Or the mother._NEWLINE_R:_START Ah, ah._NEWLINE_F:_START Frankly I’m too scared to ask about the frog._NEWLINE_R:_START Chameleon._NEWLINE_F:_START Nuance. Here’s my question (though,): if you want to see the lanterns so badly, why haven’t you gone before?_NEWLINE_R:_START Uh. Huh, well… uh, Flynn… Flynn…_NEWLINE_Capt:_START Rider!_NEWLINE_F:_START Run! _NEWLINE_R:_START Who’s that?_NEWLINE_F:_START They don’t like me. _NEWLINE_R:_START Who’s that?_NEWLINE_F:_START They don’t like me either. _NEWLINE_R:_START Who’s that?!_NEWLINE_F:_START Let’s just assume for the moment that everyone in here doesn’t like me!_NEWLINE_R:_START Here! _NEWLINE_Capt:_START I’ve waited a long time for this. _NEWLINE_F:_START Oh mama, I have got to get me one of these! _NEWLINE_F:_START Ha! _NEWLINE_F:_START You should know that this is the strangest thing I’ve ever done! _NEWLINE_F:_START How ’bout two out of three?_NEWLINE_R:_START Flynn! _NEWLINE_R:_START Flynn, look out!_NEWLINE_F:_START Whoa, whoa…_NEWLINE_R:_START Ngth! _NEWLINE_F:_START Ha!

I can’t see anything. _NEWLINE_F:_START Hey, there’s no point. It’s pitch-black down there._NEWLINE_R:_START This is all my fault. She was right, I never should have done this.  I’m so… I’m so sorry, Flynn. _NEWLINE_F:_START Eugene._NEWLINE_R:_START What?_NEWLINE_F:_START My real name is Eugene Fitzherbert. Someone might as well know._NEWLINE_R:_START Hmm. I have magic hair that glows when I sing._NEWLINE_F:_START What?_NEWLINE_R:_START I have magic hair that glows when I sing! Flower gleam and glow, let your power shine…_NEWLINE_F:_START  Whoa!   _NEWLINE_R:_START We made it._NEWLINE_F:_START Her hair glows._NEWLINE_R:_START I’m alive.

I’ll kill that Rider! We’ll cut him off at the kingdom, and get back the crown. C’mon!_NEWLINE_G:_START Boys! _NEWLINE_G:_START Perhaps you want to stop acting like wild dogs chasing their tails and think for a moment. _NEWLINE_G:_START Oh-ho, please, there’s no need for that. _NEWLINE_G:_START Well, if that’s all that you desire then be on your way. I was going to offer you something worth one thousand crowns, would have made you rich beyond belief and that wasn’t even the best part, hoho, oh well, c’est la vie. Enjoy your crown._NEWLINE_St:_START What’s the best part?_NEWLINE_G:_START It comes with revenge on Flynn Rider. —_NEWLINE_F:_START So you’re being strangely cryptic as you wrap your magic hair around my injured hand. Agh!_NEWLINE_R:_START Sorry.  Just don’t… don’t freak out.  Flower, gleam and glow Let your power shine Make the clock reverse Bring back what once was mine  Heal what has been hurt Change the fate’s design Save what has been lost Bring back what once was mine  What once was mine_NEWLINE_F:_START _NEWLINE_R:_START (Please) don’t freak out! _NEWLINE_F:_START Arrrr. I’m-not-freaking-out-are-you-freaking-out-no-I’m-just-very-interested-in-your-hair-and-the-magical-qualities-that-it-posesses-how long has it been doing that exactly?_NEWLINE_R:_START Uh, forever, I guess. Mother says when I was a baby, people tried to cut it. They wanted to take it for themselves. But, once it’s cut, it turns brown and loses its power. A gift like that, it has to be protected. That’s why mother never let me…  That’s why I never left the… hmm._NEWLINE_F:_START … You never left that tower.  And you’re still gonna go back?_NEWLINE_R:_START No! Yes. Ugh! It’s complicated. Hah. So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?_NEWLINE_F:_START Uh, yeah. Well. I’ll spare you the sob story of poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert, it’s a little bit of a… that’s a little bit of a downer. _NEWLINE_F:_START Huh. There was this book, a book I used to read every night to all the younger kids – ‘The Tales of Flynnigan Rider’. Swashbuckling rogue, richest man alive, not bad with the ladies, either. Not that he would to brag about it, of course._NEWLINE_R:_START Hmm. Was he a thief too?_NEWLINE_F:_START Uh… well, no. Actually, he had enough money to do anything that he wanted to do. He could go anywhere that he wanted to go. And, and, and for a kid with nothing, I don’t know, I… Just seemed like a better option._NEWLINE_R:_START Hmm._NEWLINE_F:_START You can’t tell anyone about this, okay? It could ruin my whole reputation._NEWLINE_R:_START Ah. We wouldn’t want that._NEWLINE_F:_START Well, a fake reputation is all a man has._NEWLINE_R:_START Hmm, hmm, hmm–_NEWLINE_F:_START Huh._NEWLINE_R:_START Hmm hmm._NEWLINE_F:_START Ahem. Well, I should, um… I, I should… I should get some more firewood._NEWLINE_R:_START Hey. For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert much better than Flynn Rider._NEWLINE_F:_START Well, then you’d be the first… but thank you._NEWLINE_R:_START  Hmm._NEWLINE_G:_START Well! I thought he’d never leave!_NEWLINE_R:_START Mother!_NEWLINE_G:_START Hello dear._NEWLINE_R:_START But I, I, I, I don’t, uh… How did you find me?_NEWLINE_G:_START Oh, it was easy really. I just listened to the sound of complete and utter betrayal and followed that._NEWLINE_R:_START  Mother…_NEWLINE_G:_START We’re going home, Rapunzel. Now._NEWLINE_R:_START You, you don’t understand. I’ve been on this incredible journey and I’ve seen and learned so much. I even met someone._NEWLINE_G:_START Yes, the wanted thief, I’m so proud. Come on, Rapunzel._NEWLINE_R:_START Mother, wait. I think… I think he likes me._NEWLINE_G:_START Likes you? Please, Rapunzel, that’s demented._NEWLINE_R:_START But mother, I… This is why you never should have left  Dear, this whole romance that you’ve invented Just proves you’re too naive to be here Why would he like you?

No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, guys, guys! _NEWLINE_F:_START –Rapunzel!  —_NEWLINE_Capt:_START Let’s get this over with, Rider._NEWLINE_F:_START Where are we going? _NEWLINE_F:_START  Oh. —_NEWLINE_G:_START There. It never happened. Now, wash up for dinner. I’m making hazelnut soup. _NEWLINE_G:_START Huh. I really did try, Rapunzel. I tried to warn you what was out there.

You brought them here? _NEWLINE_F:_START Thank you. _NEWLINE_F:_START No really. Thank you. Uh. I feel maybe this whole time we’ve just been misunderstanding one another, and we’re really just–huh— _NEWLINE_F:_START –Yeah, you’re right, we should go. _NEWLINE_F:_START Max… Max… Max! Waaahhh… _NEWLINE_F:_START Okay Max, let’s see how fast you can run. _NEWLINE_F:_START Rapunzel? Rapunzel, let down your hair!  Rapunzel, I thought I’d never see you again. Huh? _NEWLINE_R:_START  Mm-mm, mm-mm! _NEWLINE_R:_START Mm-mm! Mm…_NEWLINE_G:_START Now look what you’ve done, Rapunzel. _NEWLINE_R:_START Mm…_NEWLINE_G:_START Oh, don’t worry, dear. Our secret will die with him. _NEWLINE_R:_START Mm-mm, mm…_NEWLINE_G:_START And as for us, hmm!

For every minute of the rest of my life I will fight! I will never stop trying to get away from you!  But, if you let me save him, I will go with you._NEWLINE_F:_START  No! No, Rapunzel! _NEWLINE_R:_START I’ll never run, I’ll never try to escape. Just let me heal him, and you and I will be together. Forever, just like you want. Everything will be the way it was. I promise. _NEWLINE_R:_START Just like you want.  Just let me heal him. _NEWLINE_G:_START In case you get any ideas about following us. _NEWLINE_R:_START Eu–Eugene! _NEWLINE_R:_START Oh, I’m so sorry. Everything is gonna be okay–_NEWLINE_F:_START No, Rapunzel–_NEWLINE_R:_START I promise you. You have to trust me–_NEWLINE_F:_START No–_NEWLINE_R:_START Come on. Just breathe–_NEWLINE_F:_START I can’t let you do this._NEWLINE_R:_START But I can’t let you die._NEWLINE_F:_START  But if you do this, …_NEWLINE_R:_START Shh, shh, shh…_NEWLINE_F:_START … then you…_NEWLINE_R:_START … shh, shh…_NEWLINE_F:_START … will die._NEWLINE_R:_START Hey. It’s gonna be all right. _NEWLINE_F:_START Rapunzel, wait… _NEWLINE_R:_START  Eugene, (what…?)_NEWLINE_G:_START No! _NEWLINE_G:_START  No, no, no…  no! What have you done? What have you done?  No! _NEWLINE_G:_START Arghhh! _NEWLINE_R:_START  No, no, no, no, no, Eugene. _NEWLINE_R:_START Oh. Look at me, look at me, I’m right here, don’t go, stay with me, Eugene–flower gleam and glow, let your power shine, make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine–_NEWLINE_F:_START –Rapunzel._NEWLINE_R:_START What?_NEWLINE_F:_START You were my new dream._NEWLINE_R:_START  And you were mine. _NEWLINE_R:_START Heal what has been hurt. Change the fate’s design. Save what has been lost. Bring back what once was mine. What once was mine. _NEWLINE_F:_START Rapunzel._NEWLINE_R:_START  Eugene._NEWLINE_F:_START Did I ever tell you I’ve got a thing for brunettes?_NEWLINE_R:_START  Eugene!  — _NEWLINE_F:_START Whoa! _NEWLINE_F:_START Well, you could imagine what happened next.  The kingdom rejoiced, for the lost princess had now returned. The party lasted an entire week, and honestly I don’t remember much of it. _NEWLINE_F:_START Dreams came true all over the place. That guy went on to become the most famous concert pianist in the world, if you can believe it. _NEWLINE_F:_START And this guy? Well, he eventually found true love. _NEWLINE_F:_START As for this guy, well, I assume he’s happy. He’s never told me otherwise. _NEWLINE_F:_START Thanks to Maximus, crime in the kingdom disappeared almost overnight… _NEWLINE_F:_START … as did most of the apples. _NEWLINE_F:_START Pascal–never changed. _NEWLINE_F:_START At last, Rapunzel was home and she finally had a real family. She was a Princess worth waiting for. Beloved by all, she led her kingdom with all the grace and wisdom that her parents did before her. And as for me, well, I started going by Eugene again. Stopped thieving and basically turned it all around, but I know what the big question is, hah. Did Rapunzel and I ever get married? Well I am pleased to tell you that after years and years of asking, and asking, and asking, I finally said yes._NEWLINE_R:_START Eugene._NEWLINE_F:_START All right, I asked her._NEWLINE_R:_START And we’re living happily ever after._NEWLINE_F:_START Yes we are.  —'"
