    "Shrek was my first attempt at parsing. It went okay, but from what I've learned of other scripts, I think I can do this better now. Here, I factor in white space from the start, remove parentheticals, and lower each entry. Finally, I add the relevant annotations found in my Disney data. For my very first attempt at the Shrek dataframe, go [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Animated-Movie-Gendered-Dialogue/blob/master/code/DreamWorks_code/Shrek_Lines.ipynb). For my second attempt, go [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Animated-Movie-Gendered-Dialogue/blob/master/code/DreamWorks_code/Shrek_Lines_DataFrame.ipynb)."
