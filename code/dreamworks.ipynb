Panting, he waits\\n\\n          for the echoes of his outburst to fade.\\n\\n          Grug TURNS to the cave entrance, he prepares to BELLOW a\\n\\n          signal, but before any sound escapes his lips--\\n\\n          A CAVE GIRL, EEP, bursts from the cave.\\n\\n          3.\\n\\n                          GRUG (CONT'D)\\n\\n           You're supposed to wait for my signal\\n\\n           Eep. Eep?\\n\\n          Eep scares a pack of nearby Liyotes away. They pounce on\\n\\n          Grug briefly before scampering off. Eep spreads out on\\n\\n          an overhanging rock. She BASKS IN THE SUN.\\n\\n                          EEP\\n\\n           We've been in that cave forever.\\n\\n                          GRUG\\n\\n           Three days is not forever.\\n\\n                          EEP\\n\\n           It is with this family.\\n\\n                          GRUG\\n\\n           Eep would you come down here?

Good girls wait for\\n\\n           the signal.\\n\\n          A CAVE WOMAN, UGGA, scrambles out next. She is mostly\\n\\n          focused on catching Sandy, giving only cursory effort to\\n\\n          her display.\\n\\n                          GRUG (CONT'D)\\n\\n           Ugga.\\n\\n                          UGGA\\n\\n           As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in,\\n\\n           and you can give the signal.\\n\\n                          GRUG\\n\\n           No, I mean, you're already out now.\\n\\n           THUNK (O.S.)\\n\\n           I am waiting for the signal, dad.\\n\\n          We HEAR the voice of Grug's nine-year-old son from inside\\n\\n          the cave.

Thunk\\n\\n          picks up a boulder and throws it. It ricochets off the\\n\\n          cliff wall and careens into Grug. Grug gets plowed over\\n\\n          by the boulder.\\n\\n                          UGGA\\n\\n           Mom, we're ready to leave.\\n\\n                          (BEAT)\\n\\n           Mom!\\n\\n          Grug sits up and smiles.\\n\\n                          GRAN\\n\\n           Still alive!\\n\\n          Grug's face drops.\\n\\n                          GRUG\\n\\n           It's still early.\\n\\n                          GRAN\\n\\n           And you're still fat.\\n\\n                          GRUG\\n\\n           Breakfast formation!\\n\\n          The Croods form up in a flying wedge, with Grug in the\\n\\n          lead.\\n\\n          5.\\n\\n                          GRUG (CONT'D)\\n\\n           I want to see some real caveman action\\n\\n           out there.
