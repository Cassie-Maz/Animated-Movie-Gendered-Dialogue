    "# Tag Questions\n",
    "Tag questions are a form of collaborative dialogue. They encourage the other speaker to engage in the conversation, and ellicite the other speaker's opinion. Because female speakers are traditionally thought to be more collaborative, I hypothesize that female speakers will use more tag questions than male speakers. Also, I believe antagonists will use these less than protagonists--antagonists don't want anyone else's opinion!\n",
